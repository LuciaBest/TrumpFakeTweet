Republicans and Democrats have both created our economic problems.
<|endoftext|>
The Unsolicited Mail In Ballot Scam is a major threat to our Democracy, &amp; the Democrats know it. Almost all recent elections using this system, even though much smaller &amp;  with far fewer Ballots to count, have ended up being a disaster. Large numbers of missing Ballots &amp; Fraud!
<|endoftext|>
The threshold identification of Ballots is turning out to be even bigger than originally anticipated. A very large number of Ballots are impacted. Stay tuned!
<|endoftext|>
“I’m running as a proud Democrat, for the Senate”. Sleepy Joe Biden today. It’s only going to get worse. It is not sustainable for our County - China will own us!!!!

Nobody is showing up for Obama’s hate laced speeches. 47 people! No energy, but still better than Joe!

Pennsylvania prevented us from watching much of the Ballot count. Unthinkable and illegal in this country.

Just landed in Ohio. See you in a little while!
<|endoftext|>
Georgia will be a big presidential win, as it was the night of the Election!
<|endoftext|>
The “Surrender Caucus” within the Republican Party will go down in infamy as weak and ineffective “guardians” of our Nation, who were willing to accept the certification of fraudulent presidential numbers!
<|endoftext|>
Polls numbers are looking very strong. Big crowds, great enthusiasm. Massive RED WAVE coming!!!
<|endoftext|>
Heading to Georgia now. See you soon!
<|endoftext|>
...The worst polling ever, and then they’ll be back in four years to do it again. This is much more then voter and campaign finance suppression!
<|endoftext|>
Landed in Wisconsin. BIG CROWD. On my way!
<|endoftext|>
...ABC/WaPo had me down 17 points in Wisconsin, the day before the election, and I WON! In Iowa, the polls had us 4 points down, and I won by 8.2%! Fox News and Quinnipiac were wrong on everything...
<|endoftext|>
Who will be running for Governor of the Great State of Ohio? Will be hotly contested!

Another Vaccine just announced. This time by Moderna, 95% effective. For those great “historians”, please remember that these great discoveries, which will end the China Plague, all took place on my watch!

The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!

The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors.

Washington is being inundated with people who don’t want to see an election victory stolen by emboldened Radical Left Democrats. Our Country has had enough, they won’t take it anymore! We hear you (and love you) from the Oval Office. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Just saw the vote tabulations. There is NO WAY Biden got 80,000,000 votes!!! This was a 100% RIGGED ELECTION.
<|endoftext|>
WE WILL WIN!
<|endoftext|>
WATCH FOR MASSIVE BALLOT COUNTING ABUSE AND, JUST LIKE THE EARLY VACCINE, REMEMBER I TOLD YOU SO!
<|endoftext|>
BALLOT COUNTING ABUSE!

Looks like they are setting up a big “voter dump” against the Republican candidates. Waiting to see how many votes they need?

Highly Respected Ken Starr: “Pennsylvania’s three-day extension of the mail-in ballot deadline is a Constitutional Travesty.” Legal scholars agree!

Republicans, don’t let Andrew McCabe continue to get away with totally criminal activity. What he did should never be allowed to happen to our Country again. FIGHT FOR JUSTICE!

Just happened to have found another 4000 ballots from Fulton County. Here we go!
<|endoftext|>
Pennsylvania Party Leadership votes are this week. I hope they pick very tough and smart fighters. We will WIN!!
<|endoftext|>
I gave a long news conference today after wishing the military a Happy Thanksgiving, &amp; realized once again that the Fake News Media coordinates so that the real message of such a conference never gets out. Primary point made was that the 2020 Election was RIGGED, and that I WON!
<|endoftext|>
Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd is so happy with the fake voter tabulation process that he can’t even get the words out straight. Sad to watch!
<|endoftext|>
States want to correct their votes, which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud, plus corrupt process never received legislative approval.  All Mike Pence has to do is send them back to the States, AND WE WIN. Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!
<|endoftext|>
For purposes of National Security, Section 230 must be immediately terminated!!!
<|endoftext|>
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, OUR COUNTRY, NEEDS THE PRESIDENCY MORE THAN EVER BEFORE - THE POWER OF THE VETO. STAY STRONG!
<|endoftext|>
They just happened to find 50,000 ballots late last night. The USA is embarrassed by fools. Our Election Process is worse than that of third world countries!
<|endoftext|>
Wow! Twitter bans highly respected Pennsylvania State Senator Doug Mastriano after he did a great job of leading a hearing on the 2020 Election fraud. They and the Fake News, working together, want to SILENCE THE TRUTH. Can’t let that happen. This is what Communist countries do!
<|endoftext|>
The States want to redo their votes. They found out they voted on a FRAUD. Legislatures never approved. Let them do it. BE STRONG!

Andrew McCabe was exposed for who he is today in the U.S. Senate. He was totally destroyed - an ignorant fool. The great people of the FBI must make sure that he and his former boss, James Comey, pay the price for what they have done to the reputation of the FBI.

News Conference on Reduced Drug Prices at 2:30 P.M.
<|endoftext|>
Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!
<|endoftext|>
Our Economy is doing great, and is ready to set new records - best ever (Again!). Biden will destroy everything with his massive Tax Increases. Don’t let it happen!!!
<|endoftext|>
Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!
<|endoftext|>
The Fake News is talking about CASES, CASES, CASES. This includes many low risk people. Media is doing everything possible to create fear prior to November 3rd. The Cases are up because TESTING is way up, by far the most, and best, in the world. Mortality rate is DOWN 85% plus!
<|endoftext|>
...Why won’t they do it, and why are they so fast to certify a meaningless tally?
<|endoftext|>
The Governor of Georgia, and Secretary of State, refuse to let us look at signatures which would expose hundreds of thousands of illegal ballots, and give the Republican Party and me, David Perdue, and perhaps Kelly Loeffler, a BIG VICTORY...
<|endoftext|>
...I could not sit by and watch THEM take advantage of YOU anymore. They are coming after me because I am standing in their way, and standing guard for this Country we LOVE!
<|endoftext|>
...For years, I watched one betrayal after another, as politicians like Joe Biden sold out American Workers at every turn—shattering the lives of millions of American families while THEIR families raked in millions of dollars...
<|endoftext|>
Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and he’s COMPROMISED. China is desperate for Biden to win because if Biden Wins, CHINA WINS – and China will OWN AMERICA. This corruption is EXACTLY why I decided to run for President in the first place...

I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law &amp; Order – respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you!

On the 37th anniversary of the horrendous attack on our United States Marines, Sailors, and Soldiers in Beirut, we honor the 241 heroes who lost their lives that day. We will NEVER forget them. Semper Fi!

Joe Biden’s response to the H1N1 Swine Flu, far less lethal than Covid 19, was one of the weakest and worst in the history of fighting epidemics and pandemics. It was pathetic, those involved have said. Joe didn’t have a clue!
<|endoftext|>
The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
<|endoftext|>
These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously &amp; viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly &amp; unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love &amp; in peace. Remember this day forever!
<|endoftext|>
“The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
<|endoftext|>
So important to VOTE for Republicans in the House. Break away from Pelosi and her high Taxing new Radical Left friends. Protect your 2nd Amendment, Military, Vets, and sooo much more!
<|endoftext|>
The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!

The recent statement by Chris Krebs on the security of the 2020 Election was highly inaccurate, in that there were massive improprieties and fraud - including dead people voting, Poll Watchers not allowed into polling locations, “glitches” in the voting machines which changed...

Have a GREAT “MAGA-GRAS” Rally today on our wonderful Long Island. Cut Taxes, Stop Crime, VOTE FOR TRUMP. Our City and State are a MESS. What do you have to lose? Thank you!!!
<|endoftext|>
Important News Conference today by lawyers on a very clear and viable path to victory. Pieces are very nicely falling into place. RNC at 12:00 P.M.
<|endoftext|>
THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
<|endoftext|>
The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!
<|endoftext|>
...votes from Trump to Biden, late voting, and many more. Therefore, effective immediately, Chris Krebs has been terminated as Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
<|endoftext|>
European Countries are sadly getting clobbered by the China Virus. The Fake News does not like reporting this!
<|endoftext|>
Biden can only enter the White House as President if he can prove that his ridiculous “80,000,000 votes” were not fraudulently or illegally obtained. When you see what happened in Detroit, Atlanta, Philadelphia &amp; Milwaukee, massive voter fraud, he’s got a big unsolvable problem!
<|endoftext|>
My son Donald is doing very well. Thank you!
<|endoftext|>
Biden did poorly in big cities (Politico), except those of Detroit (more votes than people!), Philadelphia, Atlanta and Milwaukee, which he had to win. Not surprisingly, they are all located in the most important swing states, and are long known for being politically corrupt!
<|endoftext|>
A guy named Al Schmidt, a Philadelphia Commissioner and so-called Republican (RINO), is being used big time by the Fake  News Media to explain how honest things were with respect to the Election in Philadelphia. He refuses to look at a mountain of corruption &amp; dishonesty. We win!
<|endoftext|>
The restaurant business is being absolutely decimated. Congress should step up and help. Time is of the essence!

Big voter fraud information coming out concerning Georgia. Stay tuned!
<|endoftext|>
So much credit to all of the brave men and women in state houses who are defending our great Constitution. Thank you!
<|endoftext|>
Everyone is asking why the recent presidential polls were so inaccurate when it came to me. Because they are FAKE, just like much of the Lamestream Media!
<|endoftext|>
I am pleased to announce that I have given my full support and endorsement to Ronna McDaniel to continue heading the Republican National Committee (RNC). With 72 MILLION votes, we received more votes than any sitting President in U.S. history - and we will win!
<|endoftext|>
“President Trump has done many great things (biggest tax &amp; regulation cuts in history, Space Force, rebuilding our military, fixing the V.A., the Wall), but perhaps the most important of all will be what he is doing now, exposing the massive corruption in our Electoral Process.”
<|endoftext|>
The Wisconsin recount is not about finding mistakes in the count, it is about finding people who have voted illegally, and that case will be brought after the recount is over, on Monday or Tuesday. We have found many illegal votes. Stay tuned!
<|endoftext|>
Joe Biden was a total disaster in handling the H1N1 Swine Flu, would never have produced a Vaccine in record time (years ahead of schedule), and would do a terrible job of Vaccine delivery - But doesn’t everybody already know that!
<|endoftext|>
Specific allegations were made, and we have massive proof, in the Pennsylvania case. Some people just don’t want to see it. They want nothing to do with saving our Country. Sad!!!
<|endoftext|>
The number of ballots that our Campaign is challenging in the Pennsylvania case is FAR LARGER than the 81,000 vote margin. It’s not even close. Fraud and illegality ARE a big part of the case. Documents being completed. We will appeal!
<|endoftext|>
Nobody wants to report that Pennsylvania and Michigan didn’t allow our Poll Watchers and/or Vote Observers to Watch or Observe. This is responsible for hundreds of thousands of votes that should not be allowed to count. Therefore, I easily win both states. Report the News!
<|endoftext|>
The Fake News is not talking about the fact that “Covid” is running wild all over the World, not just in the U.S. I was at the Virtual G-20 meeting early this morning and the biggest subject was Covid. We will be healing fast, especially with our vaccines!
<|endoftext|>
OBAMAGATE!
<|endoftext|>
Fake News always “forgets” to mention that far fewer people are dying when they get Covid. This is do to both our advanced therapeutics, and the gained knowledge of our great doctors, nurses and front line workers!
<|endoftext|>
The Media is just as corrupt as the Election itself!
<|endoftext|>
Just don’t see any way Nancy Pelosi and Cryin’ Chuck Schumer will be willing to do what is right for our great American workers, or our wonderful USA itself, on Stimulus. Their primary focus is BAILING OUT poorly run (and high crime) Democrat cities and states....
<|endoftext|>
...P.S. Tony should stop wearing the Washington Nationals’ Mask for two reasons. Number one, it is not up to the high standards that he should be exposing. Number two, it keeps reminding me that Tony threw out perhaps the worst first pitch in the history of Baseball!

GREAT news! New government of Sudan, which is making great progress, agreed to pay $335 MILLION to U.S. terror victims and families. Once deposited, I will lift Sudan from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. At long last, JUSTICE for the American people and BIG step for Sudan!

Heading for Arizona. See you soon!

....There has never been more enthusiasm or spirit, by everyone. Great fun, and so good for our Country. Already winning many states, but not reported. Biden put the LID on again - raising money with promises. They finally caught him, COLD, and he knows it. Laptop is devastating!
<|endoftext|>
....the COURAGE to do what has to be done to maintain the integrity of our Elections,  and the United States of America itself. THE WORLD IS WATCHING!!!
<|endoftext|>
Why is Joe Biden so quickly forming a Cabinet when my investigators have found hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes, enough to “flip” at least four States, which in turn is more than enough to win the Election? Hopefully the Courts and/or Legislatures will have....
<|endoftext|>
Last week, Joe Biden made perhaps the most shocking admission ever uttered in the history of presidential debates. On live television, Joe Biden confirmed his plan to ABOLISH the entire U.S. Oil Industry—that means NO fracking, NO jobs, and NO energy for Pennsylvania Families!
<|endoftext|>
Heading for Tucson. See you in a little while. Winning Arizona!
<|endoftext|>
Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!
<|endoftext|>
....Washington wants nothing to do with him, and that’s so bad for New York, which has become a ghost town. Andrew spends too much time listening to his brother, Fredo. Forget the books and your apology tour. The Federal Government would love to help New York regain its luster!
<|endoftext|>
Governor Cuomo has shown tremendously poor leadership skills in running N.Y. Bad time for him to be writing and promoting a book, especially since he has done such a poor job with Covid and Crime. So many unnecessary deaths. The City &amp; State have sunk to historic lows...

We have some big things happening in our various litigations on the Election Hoax. Everybody knows it was Rigged. They know Biden didn’t get more votes from the Black community than Obama, &amp; certainly didn’t get 80,000,000 votes. Look what happened in Detroit, Philadelphia, plus!
<|endoftext|>
Quick stop in North Carolina with a wonderful Indian Tribe, and guests. Then off to two BIG Rallies in Ohio and Wisconsin. See you later!!!
<|endoftext|>
Joe Biden called me George yesterday. Couldn’t remember my name. Got some help from the anchor to get him through the interview. The Fake News Cartel is working overtime to cover it up!
<|endoftext|>
We have made tremendous progress with the China Virus, but the Fake News refuses to talk about it this close to the Election. COVID, COVID, COVID is being used by them, in total coordination, in order to change our great early election numbers.Should be an election law violation!
<|endoftext|>
Three BIG Rallies today. Heading to Pennsylvania. I have plenty to say about the dishonesty of the Media and Sleepy Joe. A terrible coverup is happening in our Country!!!
<|endoftext|>
....WILL APPEAL!!!
<|endoftext|>
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
We are winning big on the voting numbers. Get out and Vote. Bigger than 2016!!!
<|endoftext|>
...Based on decisions being rendered now, this list is more important than ever before (Second Amendment, Right to Life, Religous Liberty, etc.) – VOTE 2020!
<|endoftext|>
Big problems and discrepancies with Mail In Ballots all over the USA. Must have final total on November 3rd.
<|endoftext|>
Cases up because we TEST, TEST, TEST. A Fake News Media Conspiracy. Many young people who heal very fast. 99.9%. Corrupt Media conspiracy at all time high. On November 4th., topic will totally change. VOTE!
<|endoftext|>
The Fake News Media is riding COVID, COVID, COVID, all the way to the Election. Losers!
<|endoftext|>
I’m not fighting for me, I’m fighting for the 74,000,000 million people (not including the many Trump ballots that were “tossed”), a record for a sitting President, who voted for me!
<|endoftext|>
....Also, quickly check the number of envelopes versus the number of ballots. You may just find that there are many more ballots than there are envelopes. So simple, and so easy to do. Georgia Republicans are angry, all Republicans are angry. Get it done!
<|endoftext|>
....WILL APPEAL!
<|endoftext|>
The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
<|endoftext|>
In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
<|endoftext|>
No matter what you give to the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, it will never be enough!
<|endoftext|>
New York, California, Illinois. People are FLEEING, Taxes and Crime are going through the roof. VOTE TRUMP, I will turn it around, and FAST!
<|endoftext|>
Just arrived at Virtual G20. Was here yesterday also (early), but some of the Fake News Media failed to report it accurately - as usual. My speech is available (they said I didn’t make a speech).
<|endoftext|>
Other than politics, how do you lose a case where large numbers of voters, far more than you need to flip Pennsylvania, are disenfranchised? Vote Observers thrown out of counting rooms. People going to vote finding out they have already voted through a fake ballot - go home!
<|endoftext|>
Strongly Trending (Google) since immediately after the second debate is CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE? This refers changing it to me. The answer in most states is YES. Go do it. Most important Election of your life!
<|endoftext|>
Biden’s Handler’s want to expand the Court. This would be very bad for the USA. On top of that they don’t want to provide a list of who would be chosen for the Court. MUST HAVE A LIST OF THESE RADICAL LEFT JUDGES!
<|endoftext|>
In certain swing states, there were more votes than people who voted, and in big numbers. Does that not really matter? Stopping Poll Watchers, voting for unsuspecting people, fake ballots and so much more. Such egregious conduct. We will win!
<|endoftext|>
...fight, and I believe we will prevail! Nevertheless, in the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same.
<|endoftext|>
I want to thank Emily Murphy at GSA for her steadfast dedication and loyalty to our Country. She has been harassed, threatened, and abused – and I do not want to see this happen to her, her family, or employees of GSA. Our case STRONGLY continues, we will keep up the good...
<|endoftext|>
What does GSA being allowed to preliminarily work with the Dems have to do with continuing to pursue our various cases on what will go down as the most corrupt election in American political history? We are moving full speed ahead. Will never concede to fake ballots &amp; “Dominion”.
<|endoftext|>
Philadelpiha MUST HAVE POLLWATCHERS!
<|endoftext|>
ALL THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IS COVID, COVID, COVID. ON NOVEMBER 4th, YOU WON’T BE HEARING SO MUCH ABOUT IT ANYMORE. WE ARE ROUNDING THE TURN!!!
<|endoftext|>
For years the Dems have been preaching how unsafe and rigged our elections have been. Now they are saying what a wonderful job the Trump Administration did in making 2020 the most secure election ever. Actually this is true, except for what the Democrats did. Rigged Election!
<|endoftext|>
Heartwarming to see all of the tremendous support out there, especially the organic Rallies that are springing up all over the Country, including a big one on Saturday in D.C. I may even try to stop by and say hello. This Election was Rigged, from Dominion all the way up &amp; down!
<|endoftext|>
Now it is learned that the horrendous Dominion Voting System was used in Arizona (and big in Nevada). No wonder the result was a very close loss!
<|endoftext|>
Will be having a press conference from the Rose Garden in 15 minutes.
<|endoftext|>
Remember, the GSA has been terrific, and Emily Murphy has done a great job, but the GSA does not determine who the next President of the United States will be.
<|endoftext|>
AMERICA FIRST!!!
<|endoftext|>
7 DAYS!!!
<|endoftext|>
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
BIG VICTORY for patients – Federal court UPHOLDS hospital price transparency. Patients deserve to know the price of care BEFORE they enter the hospital. Because of my action, they will. This may very well be bigger than healthcare itself. Congratulations America!

700,000 ballots were not allowed to be viewed in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh which means, based on our great Constitution, we win the State of Pennsylvania!

<|endoftext|>
Section 230, which is a liability shielding gift from the U.S. to “Big Tech” (the only companies in America that have it - corporate welfare!), is a serious threat to our National Security &amp; Election Integrity. Our Country can never be safe &amp; secure if we allow it to stand.....

The “losers &amp; suckers” statement on dead military heroes has been proven to be a total fabrication and lie. IT WAS NEVER MADE! The “anonymous” fabricator, who is a major sleaze, went forward with the lie despite 25 strong witnesses to the contrary. Welcome to the roaring 20’s!

SLEEPY JOE BIDEN IS PROPOSING THE BIGGEST TAX HIKE IN OUR COUNTRY’S HISTORY! CAN ANYBODY REALLY VOTE FOR THIS?
<|endoftext|>
Senator Little Ben Sasse of the Great State of Nebraska seems to be heading down the same inglorious path as former Senators Liddle’ Bob Corker, whose approval rating in Tennessee went from 55% to 4%, &amp; Jeff “the Flake” Flake, whose approval rating in Arizona went from 56% to....
<|endoftext|>
...Nomination to run for a second term. Then he went back to his rather stupid and obnoxious ways. Must feel he can’t lose to a Dem. Little Ben is a liability to the Republican Party, and an embarrassment to the Great State of Nebraska. Other than that, he’s just a wonderful guy!
<|endoftext|>
Getting ready to speak in Florida. Enjoy!
<|endoftext|>
I will be speaking before a very important Pennsylvania State Senate hearing which is in process now. Talking about the massive voter fraud which took place in the 2020 Election!
<|endoftext|>
Biden made another big mistake. He totally mixed up two Crime Bills. Didn’t have a clue (as usual!). Also, he freely used the term SUPER PREDATOR!!!
<|endoftext|>
Big T was not a reference to me, but rather to Big Tech, which should have been properly pointed out in Twitter’s Fake Trending Section!
<|endoftext|>
Congress must now do a Covid Relief Bill. Needs Democrats support. Make it big and focused. Get it done!
<|endoftext|>
Big voter fraud hearings today in the Great State of Michigan. This election is a far bigger scandal (FRAUD!) than anyone would have thought - not even close. Watch today!
<|endoftext|>
....We cannot waste time and can only give to those states that will use the Vaccine immediately. Therefore the New York delay. Many lives to be saved, but we are ready when they are. Stop playing politics!

Joe Biden FAILED BADLY with the Swine Flu Epidemic. He knows nothing. All talk and no action!
<|endoftext|>
3 Points up in Michigan, 2 Points up in Wisconsin, 3 Points up in Pennsylvania. The Great Red Wave is forming, and getting ready to VOTE!
<|endoftext|>
The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
<|endoftext|>
Will be going to Georgia for a big Trump Rally in support of our two great Republican Senators, David and Kelly. They are fantastic people who love their Country and love their State. We must work hard and be sure they win. #USA
<|endoftext|>
They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!
<|endoftext|>
In Arizona, it turns out that 3% of the votes cast in the 100 count vote sampling were tainted or worse. This would be, if carried forward, approximately 90,000 votes more than we would need to win the State. Now we were granted a much larger sample to work with. Wow!
<|endoftext|>
There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

Looks like certain Republican Senators are getting cold feet with respect to the termination of Big Tech’s Section 230, a National Security and Election Integrity MUST. For years, all talk, no action. Termination must be put in Defense Bill!!!

Antifa SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do you job and don’t hold back!!!

Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!

Under my leadership, we achieved the most Secure Border in U.S. History! My opponent’s insane immigration plan completely eliminates U.S. borders by implementing nationwide catch-and-release. Joe Biden would make every community into a Sanctuary City for violent criminals. #VOTE

Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. He wants to send YOUR jobs to China, while his family rakes in millions from the Chinese Communist Party. If Biden wins, China will OWN the USA. When we win, YOU win, Wisconsin wins, and AMERICA wins! #VOTE

As a developer long ago, and continuing to this day, the politicians ran Chicago into the ground. I was able to make an appropriately great deal with the numerous lenders on a large and very beautiful tower. Doesn’t that make me a smart guy rather than a bad guy?

All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!

Covid, Covid, Covid is the unified chant of the Fake News Lamestream Media. They will talk about nothing else until November 4th., when the Election will be (hopefully!) over. Then the talk will be how low the death rate is, plenty of hospital rooms, &amp; many tests of young people.

The USA doesn’t have Freedom of the Press, we have Suppression of the Story, or just plain Fake News. So much has been learned in the last two weeks about how corrupt our Media is, and now Big Tech, maybe even worse. Repeal Section 230!

GET TOUGH REPUBLICANS!
<|endoftext|>
Media and Big Tech are not covering Biden Corruption!
<|endoftext|>
The only thing more RIGGED than the 2020 Presidential Election is the FAKE NEWS SUPPRESSED MEDIA. No matter how big or important the story, if it is even slightly positive for “us”, or negative for “them”, it will not be reported!

RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!

Why isn’t Twitter trending Biden corruption? It’s the biggest, and most credible, story anywhere in the world. Fake Trending!!!

John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats, together with the corrupt Fake News Media, have launched a massive Disinformation Campaign the likes of which has never been seen before. They will say anything, like their recent lies about me and the Military, and hope that it sticks... But #MAGA gets it!

Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!

Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..

Now that the Biden Administration will be a scandal plagued mess for years to come, it is much easier for the Supreme Court of the United States to follow the Constitution and do what everybody knows has to be done. They must show great Courage &amp; Wisdom. Save the USA!!!

Now it turns out that the Democrats want the Pack the Court with 26 Justices. This would be terrible, and must be stopped. Even Justice RBG was strongly opposed!

If the Supreme Court shows great Wisdom and Courage, the American People will win perhaps the most important case in history, and our Electoral Process will be respected again!
<|endoftext|>
If the two Senators from Georgia should lose, which would be a horrible thing for our Country, I am the only thing that stands between “Packing the Court” (last number heard, 25), and preserving it. I will not, under any circumstances, Pack the Court!

People have long been voting but Joe Biden has still not released his Supreme Court List of Radical Left Judges that he would like to put on the Court. Also, is he going to Court Pack? He thinks he can bluff his way through these two important questions. Can only vote against!!!

So, you’re the President of the United States, and you just went through an election where you got more votes than any sitting President in history, by far - and purportedly lost. You can’t get “standing” before the Supreme Court, so you “intervene” with wonderful states.....

The drug companies are going crazy putting up nasty ads against me asking to “withdraw my Favored Nation’s Executive Order”. They don’t want the U.S. to have the lowest drug prices in the world, but we now will. Big reductions coming. No other politician would do this!!!

For decades, Joe Biden let other countries rip you off and cheat America blind! The only people who’ve benefited from his policies are himself &amp; his family. He shows up every 4 years, and then goes back to D.C. and caters to his special interests. My only special interest is YOU.
<|endoftext|>
How do states and politicians confirm an election where corruption and irregularities are documented throughout? A Swing State hustle!
<|endoftext|>
Joe Biden is the candidate of rioters, looters, arsonists, gun-grabbers, flag-burners, Marxists, lobbyists, and special interests. I am the candidate of farmers, factory workers, police officers, and hard-working, law-abiding patriots of every race, religion and creed! #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
Biden will terminate school choice, eliminate charter schools, defund religious schools, ban prayer in public schools, indoctrinate your children with Anti-American lies, and force you to subsidize extreme late-term abortion. We believe that every child is a Sacred Gift from God!

The RINOS that run the state voting apparatus have caused us this problem of allowing the Democrats to so blatantly cheat in their attempt to steal the election, which we won overwhelmingly. How dare they allow this massive and ridiculous Mail-In Voting to occur...

The fact that the Supreme Court wouldn’t find standing in an original jurisdiction matter between multiple states, and including the President of the States, is absurd. It is enumerated in the Constitution...

....place in Detroit, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, and elsewhere. In all Swing State cases, there are far more votes than are necessary to win the State, and the Election itself. Therefore, VOTES CANNOT BE CERTIFIED. THIS ELECTION IS UNDER PROTEST!
<|endoftext|>
.....and many others voted illegally. Also, machine “glitches” (another word for FRAUD), ballot harvesting, non-resident voters, fake ballots, “stuffing the ballot box”, votes for pay, roughed up Republican Poll Watchers, and sometimes even more votes than people voting, took....

Swing States that have found massive VOTER FRAUD, which is all of them, CANNOT LEGALLY CERTIFY these votes as complete &amp; correct without committing a severely punishable crime. Everybody knows that dead people, below age people, illegal immigrants, fake signatures, prisoners,....

The Depraved Swamp have been trying to stop me – because they know I don’t answer to THEM – I answer only to YOU. Together, we will defeat the corrupt establishment, we will DETHRONE the failed political class, we will drain the Washington Swamp &amp; we will SAVE THE AMERICAN DREAM!

<|endoftext|>
I keep reading Fake News stories that my campaign is running low on money. Not true, &amp; if it were so, I would put up money myself. The fact is that we have much more money than we had 4 years ago, where we spent much less money than Crooked Hillary, and still easily won, 306-223!

Great Florida Rally tonight. Big crowd, lot of enthusiasm (you win races with enthusiasm). Just got back. Tomorrow night it’s off to Pennsylvania and another BIG crowd. We are winning. Economy is starting to boom. Good timing!!!

Biden losing big in Florida. Only Fake Polls show otherwise! Bad for Healthcare. Thinks he’s running for the Senate. Forgot Mitt Romney’s name, and where he was!
<|endoftext|>
The World Health Organization just admitted that I was right. Lockdowns are killing countries all over the world. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. Open up your states, Democrat governors. Open up New York. A long battle, but they finally did the right thing!
<|endoftext|>
Republicans should be strongly focused on completing a wonderful stimulus package for the American People!
<|endoftext|>
Sleepy Joe Biden had a particularly bad day today. He couldn’t remember the name of Mitt Romney, said again he was running for the U.S. Senate, and forgot what State he was in. If I did any of this, it would be disqualifying. With him, he’s just Sleepy Joe!

Leaving now for Florida Rally. Big crowds!

So Biden is coughing and hacking and playing “fingers” with his mask, all over the place, and the Fake News doesn’t want to even think about discussing it. “Journalism” has reached the all time low in history. Sadly, Lamestream knows this and doesn’t even care!
<|endoftext|>

At a meeting in Florida today, everyone was asking why aren’t the Republicans up in arms &amp; fighting over the fact that the Democrats stole the rigged presidential election? Especially in the Senate, they said, where you helped 8 Senators win their races. How quickly they forget!
<|endoftext|>
Last night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all instances Democrat run &amp; controlled. Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted. VERY STRANGE, and the “pollsters” got it completely &amp; historically wrong!
<|endoftext|>
VOTER FRAUD IS NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORY, IT IS A FACT!!!
<|endoftext|>
Twitter is going wild with their flags, trying hard to suppress even the truth. Just shows how dangerous they are, purposely stifling free speech. Very dangerous for our Country. Does Congress know that this is how Communism starts? Cancel Culture at its worst. End Section 230!
<|endoftext|>
How come every time they count Mail-In ballot dumps they are so devastating in their percentage and power of destruction?
<|endoftext|>
I saved at least 8 Republican Senators, including Mitch, from losing in the last Rigged (for President) Election. Now they (almost all) sit back and watch me fight against a crooked and vicious foe, the Radical Left Democrats. I will NEVER FORGET!

The “Justice” Department and the FBI have done nothing about the 2020 Presidential Election Voter Fraud, the biggest SCAM in our nation’s history, despite overwhelming evidence. They should be ashamed. History will remember. Never give up. See everyone in D.C. on January 6th.

I easily WIN the Presidency of the United States with LEGAL VOTES CAST. The OBSERVERS were not allowed, in any way, shape, or form, to do their job and therefore, votes accepted during this period must be determined to be ILLEGAL VOTES. U.S. Supreme Court should decide!

Republicans in the Senate so quickly forget. Right now they would be down 8 seats without my backing them in the last Election. RINO John Thune, “Mitch’s boy”, should just let it play out. South Dakota doesn’t like weakness. He will be primaried in 2022, political career over!!!

Twitter is shadow banning like never before. A disgrace that our weak and ineffective political leadership refuses to do anything about Big Tech. They’re either afraid or stupid, nobody really knows!

JANUARY SIXTH, SEE YOU IN DC!
<|endoftext|>
The United States had more votes than it had people voting, by a lot. This travesty cannot be allowed to stand. It was a Rigged Election, one not even fit for third world countries!
<|endoftext|>
We now have far more votes than needed to flip Georgia in the Presidential race. Massive VOTER FRAUD took place. Thank you to the Georgia Legislature for today’s revealing meeting!

Our Republican Senate just missed the opportunity to get rid of Section 230, which gives unlimited power to Big Tech companies. Pathetic!!! Now they want to give people ravaged by the China Virus $600, rather than the $2000 which they so desperately need. Not fair, or smart!
<|endoftext|>
Because of the Trump Administration, hospitals are now required, effective immediately, to publish their REAL PRICES, which will create competition and drive downs costs MASSIVELY. Won lawsuit last week. Bigger than healthcare, it’s called PRICE TRANSPARENCY....
<|endoftext|>
....Please remember who got it done!!!
<|endoftext|>
Some States are very slow to inoculate recipients despite successful and very large scale distribution of vaccines by the Federal Government. They will get it done!
<|endoftext|>
Before even discussing the massive corruption which took place in the 2020 Election, which gives us far more votes than is necessary to win all of the Swing States (only need three), it must be noted that the State Legislatures were not in any way responsible for the massive....
<|endoftext|>
....is therefore both illegal and invalid, and that would include the two current Senatorial Elections. In Wisconsin, Voters not asking for applications invalidates the Election. All of this without even discussing the millions of fraudulent votes that were cast or altered!
<|endoftext|>
....changes made to the voting process, rules and regulations, many made hastily before the election, and therefore the whole State Election is not legal or Constitutional. Additionally, the Georgia Consent Decree is Unconstitutional &amp; the State 2020 Presidential Election....
<|endoftext|>
For historical purposes remember, I was able to get rid of the INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, the most unpopular and expensive part of ObamaCare. You are no longer forced to pay a fortune for the “privilege” of NOT getting bad healthcare. This ended ObamaCare as we knew it. Thank you!
<|endoftext|>
TRANSPARENCY in medical pricing will be one of the biggest and most important things done for the American citizen. It was just put into service, January 1, against long odds and bitter opposition. Final lawsuits won last week. Enjoy all the extra money you will have!

....Just a small portion of these votes give US a big and conclusive win in Georgia. Have they illegally destroyed ballots in Fulton County? After many weeks, we don’t yet even have a judge to hear this large scale voter fraud case. The only judge seems to be Stacey’s sister!
<|endoftext|>
Why haven’t they done signature verification in Fulton County, Georgia. Why haven’t they deducted all of the dead people who “voted”, illegals who voted, non Georgia residents who voted, and tens of thousands of others who voted illegally, from the final vote tally?
<|endoftext|>
Tea Party takes down Eric Cantor - REALLY BIG WIN!
<|endoftext|>
The vaccines are being delivered to the states by the Federal Government far faster than they can be administered!
<|endoftext|>
I spoke to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger yesterday about Fulton County and voter fraud in Georgia. He was unwilling, or unable, to answer questions such as the “ballots under table” scam, ballot destruction, out of state “voters”, dead voters, and more. He has no clue!
<|endoftext|>
Something how Dr. Fauci is revered by the LameStream Media as such a great professional, having done, they say, such an incredible job, yet he works for me and the Trump Administration, and I am in no way given any credit for my work. Gee, could this just be more Fake News?
<|endoftext|>
The Swing States did not even come close to following the dictates of their State Legislatures. These States  “election laws” were made up by local judges &amp; politicians, not by their Legislatures, &amp; are therefore, before even getting to irregularities &amp; fraud, UNCONSTITUTIONAL!
<|endoftext|>
Sorry, but the number of votes in the Swing States that we are talking about is VERY LARGE and totally OUTCOME DETERMINATIVE! Only the Democrats and some RINO’S would dare dispute this - even though they know it is true!

....The Fake News Media in our Country is the real Opposition Party. It is truly the Enemy of the People! We must bring honesty back to journalism and reporting!
<|endoftext|>
...The Fake News will knowingly lie and demean in order make the tremendous success of the Trump Administration, and me, look as bad as possible. They use non-existent sources &amp, write stories that are total fiction. Our Country is doing so well, yet this is a sad day in America!
<|endoftext|>
....very often FAKE NEWS. Lamestream Media should be forced to reveal sources, very much as they did in the long ago past. If they did that, the media would be trusted again, and Fake News would largely be a thing if the past!
<|endoftext|>
Australia’s Central Bank cut interest rates and stated it will most likely further ease in order to make up for China’s Coronavirus situation and slowdown. They reduced to 0.5%, a record low. Other countries are doing the same thing, if not more so. Our Federal Reserve has us....

With Caravans marching through Mexico and toward our Country, Republicans must be prepared to do whatever is necessary for STRONG Border Security. Dems do nothing. If there is no Wall, there is no Security. Human Trafficking, Drugs and Criminals of all dimensionns - KEEP OUT!
<|endoftext|>
Very sadly, Murder cases in Mexico in 2018 rose 33% from 2017, to 33,341. This is a big contributor to the Humanitarian Crises taking place on our Southern Border and then spreading throughout our Country. Worse even than Afghanistan. Much caused by DRUGS. Wall is being built!

Remember, BIDEN is going to raise your taxes at a level never seen before. This will not only be very costly for you, it will destroy our economy, which is coming back very rapidly.

Really Big Breaking News (Kidding): Booker, who was in zero polling territory, just dropped out of the Democrat Presidential Primary Race. Now I can rest easy tonight. I was sooo concerned that I would someday have to go head to head with him!
<|endoftext|>
“We demand fairness” shouts Pelosi and the Do Nothing Democrats, yet the Dems in the House wouldn’t let us have 1 witness, no lawyers or even ask questions. It was the most unfair witch-hunt in the history of Congress!
<|endoftext|>
The ramp that I descended after my West Point Commencement speech was very long &amp; steep, had no handrail and, most importantly, was very slippery. The last thing I was going to do is “fall” for the Fake News to have fun with. Final ten feet I ran down to level ground. Momentum!
<|endoftext|>
DIRTY COP JAMES COMEY GOT CAUGHT!
<|endoftext|>
So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!
<|endoftext|>
I am a great friend and admirer of the Queen &amp; the United Kingdom. It was reported that Harry and Meghan, who left the Kingdom, would reside permanently in Canada. Now they have left Canada for the U.S. however, the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!
<|endoftext|>
Mini Mike is now negotiating both to get on the Democrat Primary debate stage, and to have the right to stand on boxes, or a lift, during the debates. This is sometimes done, but really not fair!
<|endoftext|>
For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you. The onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault! Will be stronger than ever!
<|endoftext|>
Biden said he is going to “transition out of (fracking) by 2025”. I hope Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and all of the rest were listening last night. High energy prices, massive jobs losses! Vote Trump.
<|endoftext|>
Joe Biden was very disrespectful to President Obama at last night’s debate when he said that he, Joe, “was Vice President, not President,” when trying to make excuses for their failed immigration policies. I wonder what “O” was thinking when he heard that one?
<|endoftext|>
In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!
<|endoftext|>
All the Radical Left Democrats are trying to do with the Post Office hearings is blame the Republicans for the FRAUD that will occur because of the 51 Million Ballots that are being sent to people who have not even requested them. They are setting the table for a BIG MESS!
<|endoftext|>
The number of Coronavirus cases is strongly trending downward throughout the United States, with few exceptions. Very good news, indeed!
<|endoftext|>
The LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success. The real people want to get back to work ASAP.  We will be stronger than ever before!

One of the reasons that Fake News has become so prevalent &amp; far reaching is the fact that corrupt “journalists” base their stories on SOURCES that they make up in order to totally distort a narrative or story. When you see, “five sources say”, don’t believe the story, it is....
<|endoftext|>
.....least 5 States &amp; the Nomination. Did the DNC &amp; Dems tell Elizabeth Warren to wait? If so, they were deadly, the race would have been over, &amp; Bernie would have won. Dirty double dealing? Nobody knows for sure, &amp; history will be the judge. But I say, here we go AGAIN, Bernie!
<|endoftext|>
....very often FAKE NEWS. Lamestream Media should be forced to reveal sources, very much as they did in the long ago past. If they did that, the media would be trusted again, and Fake News would largely be a thing of the past!

<|endoftext|>
Biden supports Cory Booker’s Bill that will force low income housing in the Suburbs, which will lower property values and bring crime to your neighborhoods. If Dems win, GOODBYE SUBURBS!
<|endoftext|>
JUST VOTED. A great honor!
<|endoftext|>
Biden wants to Pack the Court with Radical Left crazies. He doesn’t even want to make a list to explain who they are. Can’t let this happen!
<|endoftext|>
Obama is campaigning for us. Every time he speaks, people come over to our side. He didn’t even want to endorse Sleepy Joe. Did so long after primaries were over!
<|endoftext|>
Finally! Suburban women are flocking over to us. They realize that I am saving the Suburbs - the American Dream! I terminated the Regulation that would bring projects and crime to Suburbia. Not on my watch! Biden will bring the Regulation back, but bigger and worse.
<|endoftext|>

....It has now been determined that the Mueller Scam should never have been set up in the first place, there were no grounds. It was all an illegitimate Witch Hunt, &amp; a big price must be paid. How different my life would have been if this fraud on America was never committed!!!
<|endoftext|>
ALERT: So now we find out that the entire Mueller “hit squad” illegally wiped their phones clean just prior to the investigation of them, all using the same really dumb reason for this “accident”, just like Crooked Hillary smashing her phones with a hammer, &amp; DELETING HER EMAILS!
<|endoftext|>
The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats keep chanting “fairness”, when they put on the most unfair Witch Hunt in the history of the U.S. Congress. They had 17 Witnesses, we were allowed ZERO, and no lawyers. They didn’t do their job, had no case. The Dems are scamming America!
<|endoftext|>
They are staging a coup against Bernie!
<|endoftext|>
Democrats = 17 Witnesses. Republicans = 0 Witnesses.

The Democrat Party has given up on counting votes in Iowa. Looks like it all got computer “fried”. Nobody knows who the real winner is. Maybe it’s Sleepy Joe, but it’s not looking that way. They lost millions &amp; millions of dollars, all for NOTHING. But I WON Iowa big!

Sally Yates has zero credibility. She was a part of the greatest political crime of the Century, and ObamaBiden knew EVERYTHING! Sally Yates leaked the General Flynn conversation? Ask her under oath. Republicans should start playing the Democrats game!

Iowa and New Hampshire will not be moved from the Primary Schedule as long as I am President. Great tradition!

The only reason the U.S. has reported one million cases of CoronaVirus is that our Testing is sooo much better than any other country in the World. Other countries are way behind us in Testing, and therefore show far fewer cases!

The government of Iran must allow human rights groups to monitor and report facts from the ground on the ongoing protests by the Iranian people. There can not be another massacre of peaceful protesters, nor an internet shutdown. The world is watching.

The farmers are really happy with the new China Trade Deal and the soon to be signed deal with Mexico and Canada, but I hope the thing they will most remember is the fact that I was able to take massive incoming Tariff money and use it to help them get through the tough times!
<|endoftext|>
So much of the Lamestream Media is writing and broadcasting stories with facts that are made up and knowingly wrong. They are doing it by quoting unnamed sources that simply do not exist. These are very dangerous &amp; corrupt people, who will do anything to win. NAME YOUR SOURCES!
<|endoftext|>
Pelosi doesn’t want to hand over The Articles of Impeachment, which were fraudulently produced by corrupt politicians like Shifty Schiff in the first place, because after all of these years of investigations and persecution, they show no crimes and are a joke and a scam!

One of the greatest trade deals ever made! Also good for China and our long term relationship. 250 Billion Dollars will be coming back to our Country, and we are now in a great position for a Phase Two start. There has never been anything like this in U.S. history! USMCA NEXT!

<|endoftext|>
They are rigging the election again against Bernie Sanders, just like last time, only even more obviously. They are bringing him out of so important Iowa in order that, as a Senator, he sit through the Impeachment Hoax Trial. Crazy Nancy thereby gives the strong edge to Sleepy...

Despite reports to the contrary, Sweden is paying heavily for its decision not to lockdown. As of today, 2462 people have died there, a much higher number than the neighboring countries of Norway (207), Finland (206) or Denmark (443). The United States made the correct decision!

The Federal Reserve is wrong so often. I see the numbers also, and do MUCH better than they do. We will have a very good Third Quarter, a great Fourth Quarter, and one of our best ever years in 2021. We will also soon have a Vaccine &amp; Therapeutics/Cure. That’s my opinion. WATCH!

Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren singlehandedly destroyed the Bernie Sanders campaign by stripping voters away from his count on Super T. He lost states that he easily would have won if she had dropped out 3 days earlier. The DNC is doing it to Bernie again! Will he ever get angry?

Crazy Nancy Pelosi’s Impeachment Hoax has lifted Republican Congressional Polls (she lost the House once before!), and my Polls, WAY UP, which was expected, but it has had a great effect on Republican Senate races, including North Carolina, Kentucky, Colorado and Arizona. Thanks!

The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, don’t want justice when pushing the Impeachment Hoax, they only want to destabilize the Republican Party so they can do better in the 2020 election, &amp; that includes the House &amp; Senate. They are playing with the people by taking it this far!

The biggest loser tonight, by far, is Mini Mike Bloomberg. His “political” consultants took him for a ride. $700 million washed down the drain, and he got nothing for it but the nickname Mini Mike, and the complete destruction of his reputation. Way to go Mike!

In the highly competitive world of high tech, how come nobody has ever challenged Mini Mike Bloomberg and his very average, &amp; supposedly outdated, “stuff” that he sells to so many? Did he use his position as Mayor of New York to create what is now a monopoly? Just askin’?

Mini Mike is part of the Fake News. They are all working together. In fact, Bloomberg isn’t covering himself (too boring to do), or other Dems. Only Trump. That sounds fair! It’s all the Fake News Media, and that’s why nobody believes in them any more.

Cryin’ Chuck Schumer was on a late night show using a false talking point over &amp; over again. “We don’t have enough testing ,” he would repeat, when he knows we have done a great job on Testing, just like we have on Ventilators and everything else. He lied, gave NY SALT. Run AOC!

The Do Nothing Democrats and their leader, the Fake News Lamestream Media, are doing everything possible to hurt and disparage our Country. No matter what we do or say, no matter how big a win, they report that it was a loss, or not good enough. The Enemy of the People!
<|endoftext|>
Cryin Chuck Schumer, compared to what other Senators have brought home to their states, has brought very little back to N.Y. A totally overrated loser, the one thing he has given them is SALT. He never even called me to stop it. No wonder Cuomo &amp; most others can’t stand him. AOC!

I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work. This is just more Fake News and disinformation put out by the Democrats, in particular MSDNC. Comcast covers the CoronaVirus situation horribly, only looking to do harm to the incredible &amp; successful effort being made!

The Governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire. These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal.

So now Schumer and Pelosi want to meet to make a deal. Amazing how it all works, isn’t it. Where have they been for the last 4 weeks when they were “hardliners”, and only wanted BAILOUT MONEY for Democrat run states and cities that are failing badly? They know my phone number!

Most of the money raised by the RINO losers of the so-called “Lincoln Project”, goes into their own pockets. With what I’ve done on Judges, Taxes, Regulations, Healthcare, the Military, Vets (Choice!) &amp; protecting our great 2A, they should love Trump. Problem is, I BEAT THEM ALL!

Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, “no pressure”  Impeachment Hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have. I agree!

Never has the Republican Party been so united as it is now. 95% A.R. This is a great fraud being played out against the American people by the Fake News Media &amp, their partner, the Do Nothing Democrats. The rules are rigged by Pelosi &amp, Schiff, but we are winning, and we will win!

The reason the Democrats don’t want to submit the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they don’t want corrupt politician Adam Shifty Schiff to testify under oath, nor do they want the Whistleblower, the missing second Whistleblower, the informer, the Bidens, to testify!

The House Democrats were unable to get even a single vote from the Republicans on their Impeachment Hoax. The Republicans have never been so united!  The Dem’s case is so bad that they don’t even want to go to trial!

Bolton’s book, which is getting terrible reviews, is a compilation of lies and made up stories, all intended to make me look bad. Many of the ridiculous statements he attributes to me were never made, pure fiction. Just trying to get even for firing him like the sick puppy he is!
<|endoftext|>
Nobody in 50 years has been WEAKER on China than Sleepy Joe Biden. He was asleep at the wheel. He gave them EVERYTHING they wanted, including rip-off Trade Deals. I am getting it all back!
<|endoftext|>
Great reviews on our handling of Covid 19, sometimes referred to as the China Virus. Ventilators, Testing, Medical Supply Distribution, we made a lot of Governors look very good - And got no credit for so doing. Most importantly, we helped a lot of great people!
<|endoftext|>
....He didn’t want Bolton anywhere near him. Bolton’s dumbest of all statements set us back very badly with North Korea, even now. I asked him, “what the hell were you thinking?” He had no answer and just apologized. That was early on, I should have fired him right then &amp; there!
<|endoftext|>
When Wacko John Bolton went on Deface the Nation and so stupidly said that he looked at the “Libyan Model” for North Korea, all hell broke out. Kim Jong Un, who we were getting along with very well, went “ballistic”, just like his missiles - and rightfully so....

These horrible &amp; politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives. We need more Justices or we will lose our 2nd. Amendment &amp; everything else. Vote Trump 2020!

No, I want Big Ten, and all other football, back - NOW. The Dems don’t want football back, for political reasons, but are trying to blame me and the Republicans. Another LIE, but this is what we are up against! They should also open up all of their Shutdown States.

The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?

The opening of a Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough

The opening of a Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough was not a Donald Trump original thought, this has been going on for years, long before I joined the chorus. In 2016 when Joe &amp; his wacky future ex-wife, Mika, would endlessly interview me, I would always be thinking....

As President of the United States, I am asking for a legal solution on DACA, not a political one, consistent with the rule of law. The Supreme Court is not willing to give us one, so now we have to start this process all over again.

Biden was asked questions at his so-called Press Conference yesterday where he read the answers from a teleprompter. That means he was given the questions, just like Crooked Hillary. Never have seen this before!

....One person lost to this invisible virus is too much, it should have been stopped at its source, China, but I acted very quickly, and made the right decisions. Many of the current political complainers thought, at the time, that I was moving far to fast, like Crazy Nancy!

For all of the political hacks out there, if I hadn’t done my job well, &amp; early, we would have lost 1 1/2 to 2 Million People, as opposed to the 100,000 plus that looks like will be the number. That’s 15 to 20 times more than we will lose. I shut down entry from China very early!

When I terminated John Kelly, which I couldn’t do fast enough, he knew full well that he was way over his head. Being Chief of Staff just wasn’t for him. He came in with a bang, went out with a whimper, but like so many X’s, he misses the action &amp; just can’t keep his mouth shut,.
<|endoftext|>
....horrible BLM chant, “Pigs In A Blanket, Fry ‘Em Like Bacon”. Maybe our GREAT Police, who have been neutralized and scorned by a mayor who hates &amp; disrespects them, won’t let this symbol of hate be affixed to New York’s greatest street. Spend this money fighting crime instead!

It was not Ambassador Lighthizer’s fault (yesterday in Committee) in that perhaps I didn’t make myself clear, but the U.S. certainly does maintain a policy option, under various conditions, of a complete decoupling from China. Thank you!

....A total double standard. The only thing the Dems have going for them is their very close relationship with the Fake News Lamestream Media!

Didn’t Obama, whose Administration has now been caught cold illegally spying on the Trump campaign, recently also get caught playing golf on a course in Virginia, despite his wife Michelle urging people to stay home, before and after his round, in a major public service message?

I’m seeing Governor Cuomo today at The White House. He must understand that National Security far exceeds politics. New York must stop all of its unnecessary lawsuits &amp; harrassment, start cleaning itself up, and lowering taxes. Build relationships, but don’t bring Fredo!

....The USA was never set up for this, just look at the catastrophe of the H1N1 Swine Flu (Biden in charge, 17,000 people lost, very late response time), but it soon will be. Great decision to close our China, and other, borders early. Saved many lives!

Kenosha has been very quiet for the third night in a row or, since the National Guard has shown up. That’s the way it works, it’s all very simple. Portland, with a very ungifted mayor, should request help from the Federal Government. If lives are endangered, we’re going in!

I must say, that was a VERY boring debate. Biden lied when he said I want to cut Social Security and Medicare. That’s what they ALL said 4 years ago, and nothing happened, in fact, I saved Social Security and Medicare. I will not be cutting, but they will. Be careful!

We are getting great marks for the handling of the CoronaVirus pandemic, especially the very early BAN of people from China, the infectious source, entering the USA. Compare that to the Obama/Sleepy Joe disaster known as H1N1 Swine Flu. Poor marks, bad polls - didn’t have a clue!

Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more. Joe doesn’t know anything about it, he is clueless, but they will be the real power, not Joe. They will be calling the shots! Big tax increases for all, Plus!
<|endoftext|>
People forget how divided our Country was under ObamaBiden. The anger and hatred were unbelievable. They shouldn’t be lecturing to us. I’m here, as your President, because of them!

Death Rate from Coronavirus is down tenfold!

In Germany, Denmark, Norway,  Sweden and many other countries, SCHOOLS ARE OPEN WITH NO PROBLEMS. The Dems think it would be bad for them politically if U.S. schools open before the November Election, but is important for the children &amp; families. May cut off funding if not open!

Economy and Jobs are growing MUCH faster than anyone (except me!) expected. Job growth is biggest in history. China Virus Mortality Rate is among the LOWEST of any country. Shaping up for a good third quarter, and a great next year! NASDAQ at new record high, 401k’s way up!!!!

The Great State of Wisconsin, home to Tom Tiffany’s big Congressional Victory on Tuesday, was just given another win. Its Democrat Governor was forced by the courts to let the State Open. The people want to get on with their lives. The place is bustling!

The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies &amp, deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!

Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food &amp, for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!
<|endoftext|>
The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their “pockets.” The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton’s top aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey &amp, others

The Radical Left Mayors &amp;  Governors of Cities where this crazy violence is taking place have lost control of their “Movement”. It wasn’t supposed to be like this, but the Anarchists &amp; Agitators got carried away and don’t listen anymore - even forced Slow Joe out of basement!

It's not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries, and others. As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue...
<|endoftext|>
...peace treaty with Israel. We have taken Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table, but Israel, for that, would have had to pay more. But with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?

Kimberly Klacik is really working hard to help the people of Baltimore. She is running for Congress as a Republican, &amp; if she wins she will be an inspiration to all. She is strong on inner city rebuilding, healthcare, our Military &amp; Vets. She has my Complete &amp; Total Endorsement!

Cuomo’s been calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the state’s responsibility, such as new hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc. I got it all done for him, and everyone else, and now he seems to want Independence! That won’t happen!
<|endoftext|>
..The people of Portland, like all other cities &amp;  parts of our great Country, want Law &amp; Order. The Radical Left Democrat Mayors, like the dummy running Portland, or the guy right now in his basement unwilling to lead or even speak out against crime, will never be able to do it!
<|endoftext|>
Such respect for the people of Iran as they try to take back their corrupt government. You will see great support from the United States at the appropriate time!

Stock Market had another good day but, now that the Tax Cut Bill has passed, we have tremendous upward potential. Dow just short of 25,000, a number that few thought would be possible this soon into my administration. Also, unemployment went down to 4.1%. Only getting better!
<|endoftext|>
Many mostly Democrat States refused to hand over data from the 2016 Election to the Commission On Voter Fraud. They fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally. System is rigged, must go to Voter I.D.

As Americans, you need identification, sometimes in a very strong and accurate form, for almost everything you do.....except when it comes to the most important thing, VOTING for the people that run your country. Push hard for Voter Identification!

With all of the failed “experts” weighing in, does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn’t firm, strong and willing to commit our total “might” against the North. Fools, but talks are a good thing!

Dow just crashes through 25,000. Congrats! Big cuts in unnecessary regulations continuing.

Now that the very expensive, unpopular and unfair Individual Mandate provision has been terminated by us, many States &amp; the U.S. are asking the Supreme Court that Obamacare itself be terminated so that it can be replaced with a FAR BETTER AND MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE.....

Thank you to the great Republican Senators who showed up to our mtg on immigration reform. We must BUILD THE WALL, stop illegal immigration, end chain migration &amp, cancel the visa lottery. The current system is unsafe &amp, unfair to the great people of our country - time for change!

I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist. Look at this guy’s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!

The Fake News Media barely mentions the fact that the Stock Market just hit another New Record and that business in the U.S. is booming...but the people know! Can you imagine if “O” was president and had these numbers - would be biggest story on earth! Dow now over 25,000.
<|endoftext|>
Dow goes from 18,589 on November 9, 2016, to 25,075 today, for a new all-time Record. Jumped 1000 points in last 5 weeks, Record fastest 1000 point move in history. This is all about the Make America Great Again agenda! Jobs, Jobs, Jobs. Six trillion dollars in value created!
<|endoftext|>
Well, now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia, the Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable. They should try winning an election. Sad!

The African American unemployment rate fell to 6.8%, the lowest rate in 45 years. I am so happy about this News! And, in the Washington Post (of all places), headline states, “Trumps first year jobs numbers were very, very good.”

Brian Ross, the reporter who made a fraudulent live newscast about me that drove the Stock Market down 350 points (billions of dollars), was suspended for a month but is now back at ABC NEWS in a lower capacity. He is no longer allowed to report on Trump. Should have been fired!
<|endoftext|>
Tell the Democrat Governors that “Mutiny On The Bounty” was one of my all time favorite movies. A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain. Too easy!

Joe Biden is coming out of the basement earlier than his hoped for ten days because his people told him he has no choice, his poll numbers are PLUNGING! Going to Pittsburgh, where I have helped industry to a record last year, &amp; then back to his  basement for an extended period...

Now that Russian collusion, after one year of intense study, has proven to be a total hoax on the American public, the Democrats and their lapdogs, the Fake News Mainstream Media, are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence.....
<|endoftext|>
....Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart. Crooked Hillary Clinton also played these cards very hard and, as everyone knows, went down in flames. I went from VERY successful businessman, to top T.V. Star.....

For the 1/100th time, the reason we show so many Cases, compared to other countries that haven’t done nearly as well as we have, is that our TESTING is much bigger and better. We have tested 40,000,000 people. If we did 20,000,000 instead, Cases would be half, etc. NOT REPORTED!

When is Slow Joe Biden going to criticize the Anarchists, Thugs &amp; Agitators in ANTIFA? When is he going to suggest bringing up the National Guard in BADLY RUN &amp; Crime Infested Democrat Cities &amp; States? Remember, he can’t lose the Crazy Bernie Super Liberal vote!

Congress &amp, the President should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax when we have so many important matters pending. 196 to ZERO was the Republican House vote, &amp, we got 3 Dems. This was not what the Founders had in mind!
<|endoftext|>
The Impeachment Hoax, just a continuation of the Witch Hunt which started even before I won the Election, must end quickly. Read the Transcripts, see the Ukrainian President’s strong statement, NO PRESSURE - get this done. It is a con game by the Dems to help with the Election!
<|endoftext|>
These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly &amp, fully strike back, &amp, perhaps in a disproportionate manner. Such legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless!

Yesterday was a bad day for the Cuomo Brothers. New York was lost to the looters, thugs, Radical Left, and all others forms of Lowlife &amp; Scum. The Governor refuses to accept my offer of a dominating National Guard. NYC was ripped to pieces. Likewise, Fredo’s ratings are down 50%!

Schiff must release the IG report, without changes or tampering, which is said to be yet further exoneration of the Impeachment Hoax. He refuses to give it. Does it link him to Whistleblower? Why is he so adamant?

I hardly know Cindy McCain other than having put her on a Committee at her husband’s request. Joe Biden was John McCain’s lapdog. So many BAD decisions on Endless Wars &amp; the V.A., which I brought from a horror show to HIGH APPROVAL. Never a fan of John. Cindy can have Sleepy Joe!

Wow! 100,000 Mail In Ballots in New York City a total MESS. Mayor and Governor have no idea what to do. Big Fraud, Unfixable! Cancel Ballots and go out and VOTE, just like in past decades, when there were no problems!

Sleepy Joe Biden’s victory in the South Carolina Democrat Primary should be the end of Mini Mike Bloomberg’s Joke of a campaign. After the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates,  Mini Mike now has Biden split up his very few voters, taking many away!

Our Economy and Jobs are doing really well. Next Year will be a Record Setter. Stay Tuned!

Democrats are working hard to destroy the name and reputation of Crazy Bernie Sanders, and take the nomination away from him!

Tom Steyer who, other than Mini Mike Bloomberg, spent more dollars for NOTHING than any candidate in history, quit the race today proclaiming how thrilled he was to be a part of the the Democrat Clown Show. Go away Tom and save whatever little money you have left!
<|endoftext|>
I would find it hard to believe that failed presidential candidates Tom Steyer, or Mini Mike Bloombeg, would contribute to the Democrat Party, even against me, after the way they have been treated - laughed at &amp; mocked. The real politicians ate them up and spit them out!
<|endoftext|>
.....a very dark and lonely path! Your reputation will never be the same!
<|endoftext|>
Mini Mike Bloomberg’s consultants and so-called “advisors”(how did that advice work out? Don’t ask!), are on the “gravy train” and all making a fortune for themselves pushing Mini hard, when they knew he never had what it takes. Don’t pay them anymore Mike, they led you down....

A massive Disinformation Campaign is going on by the Democrats, their partner, the Fake News Media, &amp; Big Tech. They create false stories and then push them like has never been done before, even beyond the 2016 Campaign. It imperils our Country, and must stop now. Victory 2020!

A Poll in today’s New York Post says that 77% of “U.S. adults have confidence in their government’s ability to handle the Coronavirus (Number One), compared to other health threats.” 64% for Zika, 58% for Ebola. Others way down on list. Our professionals are doing a great job!

Getting VERY good reviews of the job the Federal Government is doing on CoronaVirus. Ventilators, building hospitals, beds and yes, Testing, have been handled incredibly well. Testing is getting exponentially better every day. Love seeing our Country safely opening up!

Our Country wants to move safely forward. There is a tremendous pent up demand. We will open big!

Liz Cheney is only upset because I have been actively getting our great and beautiful Country out of the ridiculous and costly Endless Wars. I am also making our so-called allies pay tens of billions of dollars in delinquent military costs. They must, at least, treat us fairly!!!

What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, &amp; then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately. They get record ratings, &amp; the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time &amp; effort!
<|endoftext|>
Many more people would have died from the China Virus if Sleepy Joe were your President. He didn’t even want me to close our Country to Infected China until TWO MONTHS  later, when he said I was right. Now he likes to say I didn’t close up “fast enough”. Just another politician!

Remember, the Cure can’t be worse than the problem itself. Be careful, be safe, use common sense!

I never said the pandemic was a Hoax! Who would say such a thing? I said that the Do Nothing Democrats, together with their Mainstream Media partners, are the Hoax. They have been called out &amp; embarrassed on this, even admitting they were wrong, but continue to spread the lie!

Leaving Minneapolis for a quick stop in Duluth to celebrate the opening of the Obama CLOSED Iron Range. My great honor!!!

Does anybody get the meaning of what a so-called Noble (not Nobel) Prize is, especially as it pertains to Reporters and Journalists? Noble is defined as, “having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals.” Does sarcasm ever work?

Colin Powell, a real stiff who was very responsible for getting us into the disastrous Middle East Wars, just announced he will be voting for another stiff, Sleepy Joe Biden. Didn’t Powell say that Iraq had “weapons of mass destruction?” They didn’t, but off we went to WAR!
<|endoftext|>
Crazy Nancy Pelosi and the Radical Left Democrats were just playing “games” with the desperately needed Workers Stimulus Payments.They just wanted to take care of Democrat failed, high crime, Cities and States. They were never in it to help the workers, and they never will be!
<|endoftext|>
Somebody please tell highly overrated Colin Powell that I will have gotten almost 300 Federal Judges approved (a record), Two Great Supreme Court Justices, rebuilt our once depleted Military, Choice for Vets, Biggest Ever Tax &amp; Regulation Cuts, Saved Healthcare &amp; 2A, &amp; much more!

One of the greats in the history of television, Regis Philbin has passed on to even greater airwaves, at 88. He was a fantastic person, and my friend. He kept telling me to run for President. Holds the record for “most live television”, and he did it well. Regis, we love you....
<|endoftext|>
Heading to North Carolina. See you soon!
<|endoftext|>
This week you had Joe Biden call Arizona a CITY. Nothing matters with him, however, because the Opposition Party (Lamestream Media) covers everything up - especially the corruption. The Obama/Biden Administration is the most corrupt in history. They even spied on my campaign!
<|endoftext|>
Police Chief, and most of the police in Rochester, N.Y., have resigned. The Democrat Mayor and, of courses, Governor Cuomo, have no idea what to do. New York State is a mess - No Money, High Taxes &amp; Crime, Everyone Fleeing. November 3rd. We can fix it!
<|endoftext|>
"""Donald Trump"" song is up to almost 60 million hits---- crazy!"

Unlike Senator Manchin, Big Jim Justice was very loyal to your favorite President during Pelosi’s Impeachment Scam. Big Jim is doing a tremendous job for West Virginia. Vote for Big Jim! #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
Crazy Nancy Pelosi said I made a mistake when I banned people from infected China from entering the U.S. in January. Tens of thousands of lives were saved, as she danced in the Streets of Chinatown (SF) in late February. Biden agreed with her, but soon admitted that I was right!
<|endoftext|>
The Trump Campaign has more ENTHUSIASM, according to many, than any campaign in the history of our great Country - Even more than 2016. Biden has NONE! The Silent Majority will speak on NOVEMBER THIRD!!! Fake Suppression Polls &amp; Fake News will not save the Radical Left.
<|endoftext|>
There is NO WAY a place like Pennsylvania can vote for the Radical Left and their puppet, Joe Biden, when they are against fracking, steel production, and just about everything else that Pennsylvania stands for. Likewise, Texas, and many other states!!!
<|endoftext|>
All Russia Hoax Scandal information was Declassified by me long ago. Unfortunately for our Country, people have acted very slowly, especially since it is perhaps the biggest political crime in the history of our Country. Act!!!
<|endoftext|>
The 2020 Election will be totally rigged if Mail-In Voting is allowed to take place, &amp; everyone knows it. So much time is taken talking about foreign influence, but the same people won’t even discuss Mail-In election corruption. Look at Patterson, N.J. 20% of vote was corrupted!
<|endoftext|>
I built the greatest economy in the World, the best the U.S. has ever had. I am doing it again!
<|endoftext|>
If I wasn’t constantly harassed for three years by fake and illegal investigations, Russia, Russia, Russia, and the Impeachment Hoax, I’d be up by 25 points on Sleepy Joe and the Do Nothing Democrats. Very unfair, but it is what it is!!!
<|endoftext|>
Colin Powell was a pathetic interview today on Fake News CNN. In his time, he was weak &amp; gave away everything to everybody - so bad for the USA. Also got the “weapons of mass destruction” totally wrong, and you know what that mistake cost us? Sad! Only negative questions asked.
<|endoftext|>
Could it be even remotely possible that in Roger Goodell’s rather interesting statement of peace and reconciliation, he was intimating that it would now be O.K. for the players to KNEEL, or not to stand, for the National Anthem, thereby disrespecting our Country &amp; our Flag?
<|endoftext|>
LAW &amp; ORDER, NOT DEFUND AND ABOLISH THE POLICE. The Radical Left Democrats have gone Crazy!

CNN Polls are as Fake as their Reporting. Same numbers, and worse, against Crooked Hillary. The Dems would destroy America!

The House &amp; Senate should IMMEDIATELY Approve 25 Billion Dollars for Airline Payroll Support, &amp; 135 Billion Dollars for Paycheck Protection Program for Small Business. Both of these will be fully paid for with unused funds from the Cares Act. Have this money. I will sign now!

The Lamestream Media refuses to talk about our Country’s record setting Jobs Numbers, which are indicating GREATNESS, and soon!

11,00 North Carolina residents get incorrect voter registration forms. 2000 LA County Voters received “faulty” Ballots, with NO WAY TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT. Many others throughout USA. Here we go. This will be the most corrupt Election in American History!

We will be substantially LOWERING Medicare Premiums and Prescription Drug Prices, bringing them down to levels that were not thought possible!

I have retained highly respected pollster, McLaughlin &amp; Associates, to analyze todays CNN Poll (and others), which I felt were FAKE based on the incredible enthusiasm we are receiving. Read analysis for yourself. This is the same thing they and others did when we defeated...

New York Mail-In voting is in a disastrous state of condition. Votes from many weeks ago are missing - a total mess. They have no idea what is going on. Rigged Election. I told you so. Same thing would happen, but on massive scale, with USA. Fake News refuses to report!
<|endoftext|>
...I’ll take the Endorsement of Law Enforcement all over the Country, and Joe can have the RINO’S. This Snyder mess was made during the OBiden era - no wonder they’re friends!
<|endoftext|>
The failed former Governor of Michigan, RINO Rick Snyder, who was responsible for the Flint Water Disaster (and I let him know it!), is now endorsing Sleepy Joe Biden, who doesn’t have a clue! Snyder, whose political career was ruined by Flint, hurt a lot of people in Michigan...
<|endoftext|>

Poll: Trump Better Than Biden On Economic Growth, 55% to 34%. That’s all? Who are the 34%?

Germany pays Russia billions of dollars a year for Energy, and we are supposed to protect Germany from Russia. What’s that all about? Also, Germany is very delinquent in their 2% fee to NATO. We are therefore moving some troops out of Germany!
<|endoftext|>
...Secret Service would not allow the trip to the cemetery based on very bad weather and security concerns. Now these low-life Biden handlers are making commercials of this fictional statement, with no proof, and think they can get away with it...
<|endoftext|>
On top of a lie made up by a low-life “reporter”, who is known for disinformation, the Democrats have taken his false words and put them into a TV commercial. We now have 21 witnesses stating that the story is a BIG LIE. Even Biden admits this may not be true...
<|endoftext|>
Mail-In Voting is already proving to be a catastrophic disaster. Even testing areas are way off. The Dems talk of foreign influence in voting, but they know that Mail-In Voting is an easy way for foreign countries to enter the race. Even beyond that, there’s no accurate count!
<|endoftext|>
...If in doubt, ask why the bill withholds $12 billion in highway funds until local authorities agree to federal control? I will protect the suburbs. Biden will destroy the suburbs!
<|endoftext|>
Fake News asks why I bring up Booker. It’s because Biden supports Booker’s bill that forces federal control of local zoning and low income housing in suburbs...
<|endoftext|>
For years Fake stories and investigations, then the phony Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX, next Ukraine and the failed Impeachment, now the crummy Atlantic Magazine’s MADE UP STORY, and lastly, the political hit job by rapidly fading Bob Woodward and his boring book. It never ends!
<|endoftext|>
Homeland Security or Federal Forces are little involved in Seattle, other than we have a large standby team in case of emergency. The media is calling that one wrong also. In Portland, we are protecting Federal property, including the Courthouse, which wouldn’t last a day!
<|endoftext|>
With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???

Kate Brown, Governor of Oregon, isn’t doing her job. She must clear out, and in some cases arrest, the Anarchists &amp; Agitators in Portland. If she can’t do it, the Federal Government will do it for her. We will not be leaving until there is safety!

Drug prices will soon be lowered massively. Big Pharma (Drug Companies) are advertising against me like crazy because lower prices mean less profit. When you watch a Fake Ad, just think lower drug prices!!!

My friend Herman Cain, a Powerful Voice of Freedom and all that is good, passed away this morning. Herman had an incredible career and was adored by everyone that ever met him, especially me. He was a very special man, an American Patriot, and great friend. I just got off...

Glad I was able to get the very dishonest LameStream Media to finally start talking about the RISKS to our Democracy from dangerous Universal Mail-In-Voting (not Absentee Voting, which I totally support!).

We are going to WIN the 2020 Election, BIG! #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
Must know Election results on the night of the Election, not days, months, or even years later!
<|endoftext|>
Fake News is at it again! They will take any statement from me, no matter how proper or well delivered, &amp;  systematically, in complete conjunction with all of their allies, dismantle it. With Biden, they only give him softballs, and let him read the answers from a teleprompter!
<|endoftext|>
Somebody please tell Congressman Clyburn, who doesn’t have a clue, that the chart he put up indicating more CASES for the U.S. than Europe, is because we do MUCH MORE testing than any other country in the World. If we had no testing, or bad testing, we would show very few CASES..
<|endoftext|>
.....Our massive testing capability, rather than being praised, is used by the Lamestream Media and their partner, the Do Nothing Radical Left Democrats, as a point of scorn. This testing, and what we have so quickly done, is used as a Fake News weapon. Sad!
<|endoftext|>
NOW THAT THE RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS GOT COUGHT COLD IN THE (NON) FRIENDLY TRANSFER OF GOVERNMENT, IN FACT, THEY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN AND WENT FOR A COUP, WE ARE ENTITLED TO ASK THE VOTERS FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. PLEASE REMEMBER THIS WHEN YOU VOTE!
<|endoftext|>
So disgusting to watch Twitter’s so-called “Trending”, where sooo many trends are about me, and never a good one. They look for anything they can find, make it as bad as possible, and blow it up, trying to make it trend. Really ridiculous, illegal, and, of course, very unfair!
<|endoftext|>
We just got 50% in Rasmussen, and much higher in our internal polls. We are doing a new ad campaign on Sleepy Joe Biden that will be out on Monday. He has been brought even further LEFT than Crazy Bernie Sanders ever thought possible. By the way, Bernie’s people love me on Trade!

The Fake News Media is trying to portray the Portland and Seattle “protesters” as wonderful, sweet and innocent people just out for a little stroll. Actually, they are sick and deranged Anarchists &amp; Agitators who our great men &amp; women of Law Enforcement easily control, but who...

Pelosi &amp; Schumer have no interest in making a deal that is good for our Country and our People. All they want is a trillion dollars, and much more, for their Radical Left Governed States, most of which are doing very badly. It is called a BAILOUT for many years of bad Dem Mgmt!

Pelosi &amp; Schumer blocked desperately needed unemployment payments, which is so terrible, especially since they fully understand that it was not the workers fault that they are unemployed, it’s the fault of China!

Big Pharma is taking television ads trying to make the case that I am raising prescription drug prices on seniors. The ad is a lie! What I have done will lead to a 50% REDUCTION in prices, at least, &amp; Big Pharma is not happy about it. No other President would....

Mike Pence WON BIG!

Biden will Shutdown the Economy at the tip of a hat, raise your Taxes, knock out your Second Amendment and Defund, or close, your Police. The Suburbs would be next, get ready. Also, and incredibly, PACK THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. This is not what the USA wants!!!  #MAGA

If a Republican LIED like Biden and Harris do, constantly, the Lamestream Media would be calling them out at a level never recorded before. For one year they called for No Fracking and big Tax Increases. Now they each say opposite. Fake News is working overtime!

The Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania would absolutely die without the jobs and dollars brought in by Fracking. Massive numbers! Now Biden &amp; Harris, after Radical Left Dem Primaries, are trying to change their stance. Pennsylvania wants Energy and Second Amendment!

Joe Biden has no plan for Coronavirus - ALL TALK! He was a disaster in his handling oh H1N1 Swine Flu. He didn’t have a clue, with his own Chief of Staff so saying. If he were in charge, perhaps 2.2 million people would have died from this much more lethal disease!

My visits last week to Texas and Frorida had massive numbers of cheering people gathered along the roads and highways, thousands and thousands, even bigger (by far) than the crowds of 2016. Saw no Biden supporters, and yet some in the Fake News said it was an equal number. Sad!
<|endoftext|>
So Crazy Nancy Pelosi said horrible things about Dr. Deborah Birx, going after her because she was too positive on the very good job we are doing on combatting the China Virus, including Vaccines &amp; Therapeutics. In order to counter Nancy, Deborah took the bait &amp; hit us. Pathetic!

This is the best deal the Republicans could get?

In 2016, the ABC News/Washington Post Poll was such a complete disaster that these two Fake News Organizations changed the numbers prior to the Election. Now these haters are trying the same thing, though on a lesser scale, again. Will have a bigger win than even 2016!
<|endoftext|>
People don’t remember the chaos, hatred &amp; discord that we all went through during the 8 years of Obama/Biden. St. Louis, Oakland, Baltimore, and so many other places,  were a complete &amp; total disaster. I wouldn’t be in the beautiful White House if it weren’t for Sleepy Joe, etc.

The Republicans are giving the Democrats a great deal of time, which is not mandated, to make their self serving statements relative to our great new future Supreme Court Justice. Personally, I would pull back, approve, and go for STIMULUS for the people!!!

<|endoftext|>
America's trade deficit with China is one of our greatest national security threats.  Time for Fair Trade. We must produce our own products.
<|endoftext|>
The banks were bailed out by us. They should start lending to private entrepreneurs. The banks are slowing American growth.
<|endoftext|>
Washington will continue to run record deficits into the election. We are borrowing at a rate of $1.40 from China. Truly unsustainable.
<|endoftext|>
Iran will soon take all of the oil in Iraq...and Iraq itself---Keep the oil.

Egypt is turning into a hot bed of radical Islam. The current protest is another coup attempt.  We should never have abandoned Mubarak.
<|endoftext|>
The House's failure to pass the Balance Budget Amendment was another unforced error by the GOP. Very disappointing.
<|endoftext|>
The Super Committee is finding ways to raise all our taxes without admitting it. The Republicans made a big mistake agreeing to this deal.
<|endoftext|>
ObamaCare is one of the greatest threats our country faces.  It is unsustainable and will lead America into complete insolvency.
<|endoftext|>
Regardless of the USC's ruling, ObamaCare can only be defeated politically. It must be legislatively repealed or America will go bankrupt.
<|endoftext|>
China is complaining about 2,500 marines being placed in Australia.  Meanwhile they are building bases across Latin America. #TimeToGetTough

The Federal government  has increased its employment by 12% since 2007. We need to stop replacing retired workers unless position is needed.

<|endoftext|>
The death tax should be abolished -- the Government is  simply taxing you twice. It is also a job killer.
<|endoftext|>
The Fed should not bail out the EU.  Europe's financial mess is their problem, not our problem!
<|endoftext|>
Our deficits are caused by runaway spending, not inadequate taxing. Washington does not have a revenue problem.
<|endoftext|>
The Federal government spent over $3.7 trillion last year. This is unsustainable and a true danger. The American dream is being destroyed.
<|endoftext|>
A record high 6.7% of Americans are living in extreme poverty. This is tragic.  We can do better.
<|endoftext|>
Iran's quest for nuclear weapons is a major threat to our nation's national security interests. We can't allow Iran to go nuclear.

Malfeasance at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac helped cause our current financial meltdown.
<|endoftext|>
The Oil Companies collude with OPEC to keep oil artificially overvalued. They need to be reigned in.

<|endoftext|>
Another company that the DOE has given money to just filed for bankruptcy. This is how the money we borrow at 40% from China is wasted.
<|endoftext|>
The Republicans never should have agreed to this past summer's debt deal.  Military cuts will now come along with tax increases.

The US Air Force won the war in Libya to clear the way for Islamic Extremist control of Libya.
<|endoftext|>
When will our nation's sacrifices  be respectfully appreciated? Iraq and Libya should reimburse us in oil.
<|endoftext|>
Why aren't we getting any oil from Iraq before we leave? We are leaving the country wide open for Iran. Big mistake.
<|endoftext|>
When will Washington stand up to China. China is manipulating its currency and stealing our jobs. Washington should move on legislation.
<|endoftext|>
I am happy to see the majority of the GOP candidates agree with me that the tax code must be simplified and the rates dropped.
<|endoftext|>
We are leaving Iraq after expending a tremendous amount of blood and treasure. We should be reimbursed with oil! -- Don't give it to Iran.
<|endoftext|>
The Dollar is at an all-time WWII low against the Yen. The Fed's recklessness is going to lead to record inflation.
<|endoftext|>
Why do we continue to sit idly by while China steals our national security and corporate secrets? China is an enemy, not a friend.
<|endoftext|>
The Misery Index is at a 28 year high.
<|endoftext|>
A simplified tax code will help promote growth in the private sector.
<|endoftext|>
Why did we spend billions of our money on Libya if we are not going to get any of the country's oil? What do we get out of this?
<|endoftext|>
Why is  crude oil priced at $86/Barrel?  OPEC is  ripping us off. Not worth $30/Barrel.  America needs new leaders.
<|endoftext|>
The OWS protesters are doing nothing to advance the interests of the 99%. Time for them to go home!

Iraq's government is treating us like fools. We should demand their oil.
<|endoftext|>
If ObamaCare is not repealed then we can expect stagnant growth, long term unemployment and record high premiums.

Iran was planning to attack the Israeli and Saudi DC embassies. We should respond accordingly. The diplomatic  window is closed.
<|endoftext|>
It is time for Iran to face serious consequences. This regime is a threat to our national security.

Tune in tonight to Greta van Susteren's  show, On the Record, which airs on Fox News at 9 p.m.
<|endoftext|>
Mitt Romney is right about the Chinese rip-off of America.
<|endoftext|>
The debate was very interesting last night. There were numerous winners and Governor Romney did very well.
<|endoftext|>
I don't want to be the only billionaire in America---I want all Americans to be rich.
<|endoftext|>
If the Prez wants to create jobs talk to some business people---not liberal intellectuals.
<|endoftext|>
The only way to spread economic growth is to lower taxes and end unfriendly regulatory practices.
<|endoftext|>
The Fed's reckless monetary policy is going to create record inflation.
<|endoftext|>
New study shows 80% of Congress have no business experience--it shows!
<|endoftext|>
I have traveled the world. America is the most beautiful country on Earth.
<|endoftext|>
When will we stop wasting our money on rebuilding Afghanistan? We must rebuild our country first.
<|endoftext|>
The GOP primary schedule is a disaster. Not enough time.
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats in the Super Committee want to raise taxes first in deficit talks. Huge mistake. Cut wasteful spending first.
<|endoftext|>
Looking forward to visiting the Trump Vineyard Estates today in Charlottesville, VA, for a press conference and the grand opening.
<|endoftext|>
Looking forward to speaking at #sparknb next week in Atlantic Canada--my first time ever.
<|endoftext|>
Sadly, Vanity Fair is a rapidly dying magazine. Needs new blood--and fast! Going the way of SPY Magazine.
<|endoftext|>
The unemployment numbers are tragic. We are letting the world take our jobs.  It has to stop!
<|endoftext|>
Everyone should boycott Italy if Amanda Knox is  not freed---she is totally innocent.
<|endoftext|>
America needs a tough negotiator---not a community organizer.
<|endoftext|>
A simplified tax code would spur economic growth and help create jobs. Unfortunately,  Washington is incapable of simplifying anything.
<|endoftext|>
The Iranians have just threatened to send warships to our coasts. They laugh at us. We can't allow them to develop nuclear weapons.
<|endoftext|>
The Fed's reckless policies of low interest and flooding the market with dollars needs to be stopped or we will face record inflation.
<|endoftext|>
China does not negotiate from a position of strength, we simply negotiate against ourselves. We have all the advantages but don't execute.
<|endoftext|>
Really bad ratings  for Lawrence O'Donnell on MSNBC---O'Reilly is killing him!
<|endoftext|>
"""Sleepy"" Chuck Todd of NBC falls far short of the late great Tim Russert."
<|endoftext|>
China is stealing our jobs. We need to demand China stop manipulating its currency and end its rampant corporate espionage.
<|endoftext|>
ObamaCare must be completely repealed. A recent report from UBS shows that it is the number one reason employers are not hiring.
<|endoftext|>
Happy New Year to all my Jewish friends.
<|endoftext|>
Our country's debt crisis cannot be solved by tax increases. We must cut government spending.
<|endoftext|>
Obama Care’s taxes vest in 2014. Conveniently after the 2012 election. Coincidence?
<|endoftext|>
OPEC is ripping us off on oil. We are ripping ourselves off by investing in unproven green energy. #Solyndra
<|endoftext|>
Government waste, fraud and abuse should be immediately addressed. This will help solve our deficit crisis both short and long term.
<|endoftext|>
Australia is a beautiful country with terrific people who love America.
<|endoftext|>
China is neither an ally or a friend--they want to beat us and own our country.
<|endoftext|>
Our next President must stop China's Rip-off of America.
<|endoftext|>
Rick Perry is right when he says we must stand by Israel in the UN.
<|endoftext|>
ObamaCare will destroy small business--the backbone of America's economy.
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Sorry I will miss the CPAC gathering in Orlando--there in spirit--Obama must go.
<|endoftext|>
How will raising taxes create jobs? Washington is all out of answers. New leadership is needed.
<|endoftext|>
If China had a tenth of the natural resources we do then they would already be energy independent. Instead we continue to buy oil from OPEC.
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
I'm looking forward to seeing you all this afternoon at Macy's Herald Square.  5:30 pm at the Crystal department on 8.
<|endoftext|>
The White House is continuing to be openly uncooperative with the Fast and Furious investigation. American lives were lost. We need answers.
<|endoftext|>
The American economy would grow if Washington didn’t keep threatening higher taxes and more regulations. Government is not the solution.
<|endoftext|>
Iran’s nuclear program must be stopped – by any and all means necessary.
<|endoftext|>
Very exciting. I will be at Macy’s Herald Square this Wednesday at 5:30pm to celebrate the launch of Trump Home crystal!
<|endoftext|>
Want jobs? Slash corporate tax rate.  Tax incentives for companies that create jobs in US.  America will boom.
<|endoftext|>
"I watched POTUS speech from Europe---same old ""tax and spend"" won't create jobs."
<|endoftext|>
A robust growing economy is how to fix Social Security and Medicare---not cuts on Seniors.
<|endoftext|>
"US should have told Libya ""Rebels"" --- give us 50% of your oil for our military support."
<|endoftext|>
Fast and Furious gun running goes all the way to the White House.  We need answers now!
<|endoftext|>
The White House is predicting 9% unemployment throughout 2012 – and when Obama Care takes effect in 2014 expect it to go even higher.
<|endoftext|>
Make no mistake---Fast and Furious goes ALL the way to the White House.
<|endoftext|>
We must stand firm against the UN's ploy to sabotage Israel---if the UN grants the PA statehood then we must immediately defund it.
<|endoftext|>
China's business interests reach far and wide---even domestically within our borders. We need to reassess our relationship.
<|endoftext|>
The new Libyan Government should turn over the Lockerbie bomber---now.
<|endoftext|>
ObamaCare must be fully repealed or it will destroy America's small businesses.
<|endoftext|>
If the UN unilaterally grants the Palestinians statehood, then the US should cut off all its funding. Actions have consequences.
<|endoftext|>
If the Palestinians want statehood then why are they run by the terrorist group Hamas?
<|endoftext|>
Crude is at $85 right now – isn’t even worth half that. OPEC is ripping us off.
<|endoftext|>
Libyan Rebels should have given us 50% of the oil in return for our military support---we don't even ask!
<|endoftext|>
More and more Americans seem fed up with both Parties----I agree.
<|endoftext|>
There is no substitute for private sector experience.
<|endoftext|>
America needs a President who can negotiate better deals for the American People.
<|endoftext|>
China's corporate espionage is a continued threat to the American economy. With the right leadership, it can be stopped.
<|endoftext|>
There usually is an easy solution to every problem. For instance, a lot of our country's problems can be solved in next year's election.
<|endoftext|>
We have spent over $1 Billion on the  Libya operation. What are we getting back?
<|endoftext|>
As bad as Qaddafi was---what comes next in Libya will be worse---just watch.
<|endoftext|>
Let's not start celebrating over Libya until we see who takes over.
<|endoftext|>
We  spent over a billion on Libya and lead the way---why is Europe getting the oil?
<|endoftext|>
We don't need another stimulus. The first one was a complete failure. Why repeat the same mistake?
<|endoftext|>
Israel is being barraged by rockets from Gaza recently. They must respond accordingly in defense of their citizens.
<|endoftext|>
Insurgents in Iraq show they can still mount horrifying attacks---US wastes  trillions.
<|endoftext|>
Karl Rove --lost GOP both Houses of Congress and the White House--gave us Obama.
<|endoftext|>
Ron Paul is right when he says we are wasting lives and money in Iraq and Afghanistan.
<|endoftext|>
Amazing--Obama speaks, market goes  DOWN---Trump tells CNBC he's buying stock---market goes UP --- should not be that way!
<|endoftext|>
China is a threat to America. They are not our friend.
<|endoftext|>
Unemployment is plaguing both Black and Hispanic youths. Very troubling.
<|endoftext|>
Reporters say it's the Trump Bump---I tell CNBC I am buying stocks--- and the market goes up.
<|endoftext|>
Economic growth can save Social Security, Medicare and America.
<|endoftext|>
Mike Huckebee, a great guy, said the President should appoint me Treasury Secretary. China and OPEC would not be happy.
<|endoftext|>
Ron Paul is right that we are wasting trillions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
<|endoftext|>
Obama has no understanding of how to create jobs or opportunity. He believes in Government.
<|endoftext|>
It's easy to see why Americans are sick of career politicians and both parties.
<|endoftext|>
How will Mitt Romney defend his  record on jobs and Romneycare in tonight's debate?
<|endoftext|>
Looking forward to the GOP  debate and the outcome of the Ames straw poll. We must get a real leader.
<|endoftext|>
The Fed continues to flood the market with US dollars. Wrong move.
<|endoftext|>
Oil is starting to rise again despite the horrible times. OPEC continues to rip us off. Not worth $30. New leadership needed.
<|endoftext|>
Obama Care is already having a devastating impact on our economy.
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Morning Joe Panel is stealing many of  my statements and ideas to better America without giving credit -- the story of my life!
<|endoftext|>
Republicans gave Obama a free pass to the White House -- they just don't get it.
<|endoftext|>
I believe America can be great only with proper leadership.
<|endoftext|>
Wake Up America -- China is eating our lunch.
<|endoftext|>
All those politicians in Washington and not one good negotiator.
<|endoftext|>
No taxes the only good thing about DC Debt Deal.
<|endoftext|>
Why should we have any defense cuts in any deal? America must remain strong.
<|endoftext|>
Disappointed in GOP and Dems---Giving Obama power to raise the debt limit next year is  a mistake.
<|endoftext|>
Ex-Presidential Pollster Pat Cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure.

<|endoftext|>
Higher Taxes kill job creation---cut wild government spending and waste.
<|endoftext|>
China has so much of our debt that they can't put us in default w/o killing themselves---US needs our toughest negotiator---and fast!
<|endoftext|>
America's debt is greater than our GDP. Time for new thinking.
<|endoftext|>
Fiscal mismanagement of cash costing US Taxpayer billions---cut fraud and waste before cutting funding for Seniors.
<|endoftext|>
Obama, sadly, has no business or private sector background---and it shows.
<|endoftext|>
The Answer to both Social Security and Medicare is a robust growing economy---not cuts on the elderly.
<|endoftext|>
We need a balanced budget Amendment because Congress has no fiscal discipline.

<|endoftext|>
Robust Economic growth is the answer to the Medicare Problem--not cuts on the elderly.
<|endoftext|>
So China is ordering us to raise the Debt Limit...How low have we as a nation sunk?
<|endoftext|>
The GOP doesn't waste  an opportunity to waste an opportunity. Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal.

<|endoftext|>
With long gas lines &amp, total disarray from storm, the hurricane may yet be a negative for Obama.
<|endoftext|>
It was announced this morning that unemployment rose--this can't be good for Obama.
<|endoftext|>
Next year I will be changing the name of 800 acre Doral to Trump National Doral. It will be the best resort in the country—Miami is hot!
<|endoftext|>
I will start reviewing various political reporters etc &amp, websites as to their professionalism &amp, fairness—many people asking for this.
<|endoftext|>
How could Obama leave those American heroes out to die in Benghazi?  And he continues to lie to the public!
<|endoftext|>
What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications?
<|endoftext|>
Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy.  How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi?
<|endoftext|>
Everybody knows why Obama would not show his college applications --- they are just not willing to say!
<|endoftext|>
If I would have offered Obama a billion dollars to show his records, he would have refused.
<|endoftext|>
I will soon be releasing my response to the fact that President Obama refused to show his applications and records to the public.
<|endoftext|>
President Obama missed the deadline!
<|endoftext|>
Obama is a terrible negotiator. He bails out Chrysler and now Chrysler wants to send all Jeep manufacturing to China--and will!
<|endoftext|>
Why is Obama’s auto bailout now creating jobs in China?  He is ruining American industry.
<|endoftext|>
You know the world is crazy when New York gets hit by a hurricane-- and Florida doesn't.
<|endoftext|>
Let's continue to destroy the competitiveness of our factories &amp, manufacturing so we can fight mythical global warming. China is so happy!
<|endoftext|>
From 1954 to 1960 there were 10 major hurricanes that hit the East Coast.
<|endoftext|>
It's 10 AM: Two hours to go for Obama to easily pick up millions for charity!
<|endoftext|>
"""The successful man will profit from his mistakes and try again in a different way."" -- Dale Carnegie"
<|endoftext|>
Obama is now standing in a puddle acting like a President--give me a break.
<|endoftext|>
A lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5M will be donated to.  The onus is on Obama to first release his records.
<|endoftext|>
President Obama, if it is important to you, I will substantially increase the $5M offer!
<|endoftext|>
President Obama, please take the $5M check for charity tomorrow. It is so easy and could do so much good!
<|endoftext|>
Thanks for all the nice words on my keeping the Trump Tower atrium accessible to stranded victims of #Sandy. My honor.
<|endoftext|>
A lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with Obama’s lack of transparency. I don't blame them.
<|endoftext|>
There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the $5M to a charity of Obama’s choice, once he releases all of his records.
<|endoftext|>
In the spirit of transparency, Obama should immediately release the 9.11 tape of Tyrone Woods pleading for military support in Benghazi.
<|endoftext|>
Today Barack Obama is standing in water in NJ. Remember on election day that he has put the US underwater.
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations Kevin Gabriel on your amazing article. If I were a journalist this would be the next Watergate, and I would be a star.
<|endoftext|>
The water damage to NYC is amazing. The winds were bad but the water was worse.
<|endoftext|>
Kevin Garnett's response to Ray Allen last night was that of a great competitor--nothing wrong--in fact it was terrific. A champion!
<|endoftext|>
I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity-- or to which charity the money will go.
<|endoftext|>
The President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5M for his favorite charity. Looking like he won't be doing it. What is he hiding?
<|endoftext|>
Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm?
<|endoftext|>
Scary.  Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years.  4 more years?
<|endoftext|>
Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?
<|endoftext|>
Let’s be honest, if Obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm, then he would have been in Ohio on Monday.
<|endoftext|>
How did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 9.12, the day after he refused to send help to Americans in Benghazi?
<|endoftext|>
"""Without focus, it's just impossible to be successful at anything."" --Midas Touch"
<|endoftext|>
I never fall for scams.  I am the only person who immediately walked out of my ‘Ali G’ interview
<|endoftext|>
Another great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders. They are American heroes.
<|endoftext|>
These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP. Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history.
<|endoftext|>
The Trump Tower atrium is such a great place &amp, kept thousands of people warm &amp, safe during the storm--thanks, staff!
<|endoftext|>
Don't let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states.
<|endoftext|>
I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap, I would have been lambasted from coast to coast.
<|endoftext|>
Because of the hurricane, I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama's favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday.
<|endoftext|>
Not only giving out money, but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President --- don't fall for it.
<|endoftext|>
Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.
<|endoftext|>
I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm.
<|endoftext|>
All weights are on crane's wrong side ---  very precarious below, move out!
<|endoftext|>
If authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower, call office.
<|endoftext|>
We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium--they are seeking refuge. Free coffee and food.
<|endoftext|>
So far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY, not nearly as bad as stated on news. Let's see what happens later.
<|endoftext|>
Many people walked out on Madonna's concert when she told them to vote for Obama. Years ago I walked out because the concert was terrible!
<|endoftext|>
Obama lied 100% about Libya and the killings--emails are absolute. He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies.
<|endoftext|>
I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go.
<|endoftext|>
Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- I agree.
<|endoftext|>
"A lot changed when David Letterman said "" he was probably born in this country""--- the word probably is a total disaster for Obama."
<|endoftext|>
Alert...The president knew that the ambassador was being attacked  in Benghazi. He did nothing...he is no leader.
<|endoftext|>
I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President.
<|endoftext|>
The TODAY Show should call me about who to put on the show— I know more about people who get ratings than anyone.
<|endoftext|>
If Obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent, what will he say?
<|endoftext|>
If my offer is refused, every undecided OH voter will be fully aware that Obama denied $5M to charity all because he is hiding something!
<|endoftext|>
Barack Obama has everything to gain. Why would anyone ever deny $5M to charity?
<|endoftext|>
Story will be released today at 12 noon EST on Twitter and Facebook.
<|endoftext|>
I have decided to add a caveat to my offer. Obama can't decide to send my $5M to Rev. Wright if he releases his records.
<|endoftext|>
My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohio--make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day. Know you can! Must win Ohio.
<|endoftext|>
Looking forward to being the special guest at tonight's Dutchess County #GOP dinner--to a SOLD OUT crowd. It will be great fun.
<|endoftext|>
...Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.
<|endoftext|>
Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. The Middle East is a mess. Yet Colin Powell still endorses him. Wonder why?
<|endoftext|>
"Be careful of an Obama ""bomb"" to win election! Would be a horrible thing to do."
<|endoftext|>
...a real loser named Tim O'Brien--and it's never recovered.
<|endoftext|>
... I will soon start naming magazines that I think will fold--I predicted Newsweek.
<|endoftext|>
....instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause.
<|endoftext|>
Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi.
<|endoftext|>
"""The dealmaker is cunning, secretive, focused and never settles for less than he wants."" --The America We Deserve"
<|endoftext|>
It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop $5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent.
<|endoftext|>
Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires...
<|endoftext|>
For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitt's tax returns, you would think my offer to donate $5M to charity for his records is an easy go.
<|endoftext|>
...Bad decisions can be devastating.
<|endoftext|>
What will be the response on Wednesday? If Obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity.
<|endoftext|>
I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute $5M to any charity of his choice.  Everyone wins.  Take the deal.
<|endoftext|>
I am happy to have started #ObamasFavoriteCharity. Really enjoying reading everyone's tweets.
<|endoftext|>
"Just stated by a total pro: ""You are the only one who has the guts to say what we are all thinking."""
<|endoftext|>
In light the Benghazi emails released last night, it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public...
<|endoftext|>
... By releasing his records, he can come clean with the American people and have $5 million go to a charity.
<|endoftext|>
Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets.  Why can't he release his records?  Especially when $5M is going to charity.
<|endoftext|>
I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses.  All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people
<|endoftext|>
My offer to Obama is about transparency. In 2008, American people were sold on hope and change. This our last chance to get the full record.
<|endoftext|>
The response has been fantastic--- actually overwhelming! Thank you!
<|endoftext|>
All predictions re: my 12 o'clock release are totally incorrect.  Stay tuned!
<|endoftext|>

"Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert &amp, Kristen.I don't have time except to say ""Robert, drop her, she cheated on you &amp, will again!"""
<|endoftext|>
"Last night was the first time Obama said ""we"" instead of ""I"" in respect to Bin Laden's killing."
<|endoftext|>
Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden--- now he wants all of the credit!
<|endoftext|>
My announcement is tomorrow!
<|endoftext|>
Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject!
<|endoftext|>
China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own!
<|endoftext|>
Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Laden’s killing, not the President.
<|endoftext|>
"When the military informed Obama that they had Bin Laden, is there anyone with a brain that would not have said ""Ok, go get him""?"
<|endoftext|>
Lance Armstrong fought for 7 years &amp, then just ran out of energy. Very sad story--although they caught him red handed.He definitely cheated!
<|endoftext|>
"""Casting sometimes is fate and destiny more than skill and talent, from a director's point of view."" -- Steven Spielberg"
<|endoftext|>
The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy-- and I mean much more.
<|endoftext|>
Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. Viewership will be way down.
<|endoftext|>
Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate
<|endoftext|>
Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight. Always treated me fairly.
<|endoftext|>
Well this is it, the final debate- let's see how it goes. I'll be tweeting live.
<|endoftext|>
Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K.
<|endoftext|>
Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see!
<|endoftext|>
Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years, he will thank me. Be smart, Robert.
<|endoftext|>
The brass in #TRUMP Tower's atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork. I keep the atrium impeccable. Key to its success!
<|endoftext|>
My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick --very thrilling.
<|endoftext|>
I wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy.
<|endoftext|>
Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected--be careful Republicans!
<|endoftext|>
Autism rates through the roof--why doesn't the Obama administration do something about doctor-inflicted autism. We lose nothing to try.
<|endoftext|>
Lots of autism and vaccine response. Stop these massive doses immediately. Go back to single, spread out shots! What do we have to lose.
<|endoftext|>
Stay tuned for my big Obama announcement--- probably on Wednesday.
<|endoftext|>
People are going crazy with my comments on Diet Coke (soda). Let's face it--this stuff just doesn't work. It makes you hungry.
<|endoftext|>
Obama should stop talking about wind turbines--they are a disaster for a country or community &amp, are very expensive &amp, unreliable.
<|endoftext|>
I will be live tweeting during the debate tonight.
<|endoftext|>
Gas prices are at crazy levels--fire Obama!
<|endoftext|>
"""They succeed, because they think they can."" -- Virgil"
<|endoftext|>
The biggest problem with A-Rod is he is bad for the chemistry of the Yankees--- he must go.
<|endoftext|>
Fort Hood shooting should be declared a terror attack. Respect the wounded and dead.
<|endoftext|>
Good luck to Derek on his operation. I know it will be a success--- he is a great champion.
<|endoftext|>
Derek must move back into one of my buildings immediately. It will be lucky for him like in past.
<|endoftext|>
Derek Jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in Trump World Tower.
<|endoftext|>
7.8% unemployment number is a complete fraud as evidenced by the jobless claims number released yesterday.Real unemployment is at least 15%
<|endoftext|>
"Obama has called Libya attack ""a bump in the road"" and ""not optimal."" Just come clean already--tell Americans the truth!"
<|endoftext|>
Maybe Derek Jeter should ask A-Rod about renting his apartment next year. Very soon A-Rod won't need a place in NYC.
<|endoftext|>
Yes--I will be live tweeting during the final debate this coming Monday.
<|endoftext|>
So many tweets &amp, stories on Stewart/Pattinson Look, it doesn't matter-- the relationship will never be the same. It is permanently broken.
<|endoftext|>
"Obama said ""not optimal"" to Ambassador &amp, embassy killings--bad word usage for a Harvard graduate."
<|endoftext|>
I'll be making a major announcement on President Obama next week--stay tuned!
<|endoftext|>
Can't believe we are less than three weeks away from the election. Time certainly flies!

The Yankees are absolutely terrible--- what happened to this team?
<|endoftext|>
The last time I visited China I couldn't believe all the construction. You can go up with a project in a week--no red tape.
<|endoftext|>
It's Thursday. How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects?
<|endoftext|>
Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?
<|endoftext|>
Bad sign for Obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states. Their internals must be horrendous.
<|endoftext|>
Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen- but I'm right. If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider.
<|endoftext|>
Newsweek ending print edition--sad. Now my Newsweek covers mean nothing--they lost all credibility. TIME to follow?
<|endoftext|>
Lots of response to my Pattinson/Kristen Stewart reunion. She will cheat again--100 certain--am I ever wrong?
<|endoftext|>
Alert--US jobless claims up 46,000 to 388,000. Really bad news. 7.8% is now a fraud--not possible!
<|endoftext|>
Obama's spending and borrowing is burying America and destroying our children's future. Does he even care?
<|endoftext|>
Mitt's proposed tax cuts for the middle class will spur record economic growth.
<|endoftext|>
If Obama goes after Mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then Mitt should ask for Obama's college records--all of them.
<|endoftext|>
What is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all. We should be given credit for taking this risk.
<|endoftext|>
Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight?
<|endoftext|>
Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog &amp, will do it again--just watch. He can do much better!
<|endoftext|>
Initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped. See what happens when I am not mentioned.
<|endoftext|>
Obama talks about what he is going to do--why the hell didn't he just do it, especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary
<|endoftext|>
Obama was beaten but not knocked out.  He lives to fight another day. But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance...
<|endoftext|>
If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically, environmentally &amp, aesthetically.
<|endoftext|>
"Remember, new ""environment friendly""  lightbulbs can cause cancer. Be careful-- the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care."
<|endoftext|>
Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds, they are killing the finances &amp, environment of many countries &amp, communities.
<|endoftext|>
"My twitter followers will soon be over 2 million--&amp, all the ""biggies."" It's like having your own newspaper."
<|endoftext|>
My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth.
<|endoftext|>
Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama. Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. Don't put it past him!
<|endoftext|>
Obama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively.
<|endoftext|>
Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night? I don't!
<|endoftext|>
Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period!
<|endoftext|>
I still love Derek, he is a winner!
<|endoftext|>
Remember, I said Derek don't sell your Trump World Tower apartment...its been lucky for you. The day after he sold it, he broke his foot.
<|endoftext|>
At the debate, the President kept talking of what he is going to do. I kept saying, why didn't he do it?  He lost me a long time ago.
<|endoftext|>
"George Will said ""best debate he ever saw"". If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting."
<|endoftext|>
Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows.
<|endoftext|>
You talk tough, Mr. President, but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy.
<|endoftext|>
Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done.
<|endoftext|>
Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton.
<|endoftext|>
Obama weak on immigration. All words, no action. He's been Prez 4 years.
<|endoftext|>
Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk.
<|endoftext|>
Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?
<|endoftext|>
"Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say ""let's get ready to rumble""!"
<|endoftext|>
We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.They just don't believe we would.
<|endoftext|>
For political purposes only, Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election?
<|endoftext|>
"""If we did all the things we are capable of, we would literally astound ourselves."" -- Thomas Edison"
<|endoftext|>
Get ready for tonight!
<|endoftext|>
I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi.
<|endoftext|>
Between Libya, the national security leaks and Fast &amp, Furious, Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President.
<|endoftext|>
Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate, tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real.
<|endoftext|>
The Coca Cola company is not happy with me--that's okay, I'll still keep drinking that garbage.
<|endoftext|>
Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. At least he is consistent.
<|endoftext|>
Diet Coke tweet had a monster response--dammit, I wish the stuff worked.
<|endoftext|>
Verlander is great but  very beatable. Does not have a good ERA in playoff games
<|endoftext|>
I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers.
<|endoftext|>
Lots of pressure on Obama tonight--even more than A-Rod. If he doesn't perform well it could be over.
<|endoftext|>
I hope A-Rod has a great night for the Yankees--he owes it to them--especially with Derek hurt.
<|endoftext|>
Based on very popular demand, I will be live tweeting tomorrow night during the Presidential debate.
<|endoftext|>
"""Sometimes the best thing you can do is just let things ride, let time go by.""Donald J. Trump"
<|endoftext|>
Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator. He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us.
<|endoftext|>
Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history.
<|endoftext|>
Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think.
<|endoftext|>
Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke- let's face it, it doesn't work- just makes you hungry.
<|endoftext|>
A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice!
<|endoftext|>
Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma?
<|endoftext|>
A-Rod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.
<|endoftext|>
Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.
<|endoftext|>
Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!
<|endoftext|>
I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke.
<|endoftext|>
Yankees can win today. Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher.
<|endoftext|>
A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat. Time for him to step up and leave.
<|endoftext|>
Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night.
<|endoftext|>
A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion.
<|endoftext|>
So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose.
<|endoftext|>
Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away. Scrape and paint before too late.
<|endoftext|>
Tonight, despite everything, put A-Rod in the lineup.
<|endoftext|>
Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason.
<|endoftext|>
They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer.
<|endoftext|>
Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series.
<|endoftext|>
I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.
<|endoftext|>
Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won.
<|endoftext|>
"When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say "" what were we doing""."

When an employee leaves me and begs to come back--I never let them. Loyalty is very important.
<|endoftext|>
I look forward to Tuesday night's presidential debate--I wonder if Obama will use my name again.
<|endoftext|>
Very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate.
<|endoftext|>
Obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families. The price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected.
<|endoftext|>
My Scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world--a great honor for me.
<|endoftext|>
Credibility is important to me- hence must admit that both candidates did really well last night. #VPDebate

"""Wing bangers""-- the name given to wind turbines by bird lovers for the thousands of birds they kill in the U.S."
<|endoftext|>
British PM Cameron is making a fool of himself by wasting billions of pounds on unwanted &amp, environment destroying Scottish windmills.
<|endoftext|>
Pretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think? #VPDebate
<|endoftext|>
Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat. #VPDebate
<|endoftext|>
Biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. #VPDebate
<|endoftext|>
Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can. #VPDebate
<|endoftext|>
Both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind. #VPDebate
<|endoftext|>
Get ready- this should be informative and fun! #VPDebate
<|endoftext|>
Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment.
<|endoftext|>
It's Thursday and only 26 days until the election. How many illegal donations from China and Saudi Arabia did Obama collect today?
<|endoftext|>
Our foreign policy decisions are dumbest in U.S. history
<|endoftext|>
Live tweeting during tonight's VP debate...should be a great time
<|endoftext|>
How the hell does the Libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection?!
<|endoftext|>
"Why the hell did we help the Libyan ""rebels"" in the first place. That is the real scandal."
<|endoftext|>
I guess they have Lance Armstrong cold. Brutal report. A waste of taxpayer money to take down an American hero.
<|endoftext|>
"Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A-Rod--to put it ""mildly"" -- The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter."
<|endoftext|>
Asking why my dislike of A-Rod--dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal
<|endoftext|>
Great move to take A-Rod out of game. Now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs).

Michele Bachmann just dropped out of prez race--- when she didn't do the Newsmax debate it showed great disloyalty and people rejected her.

What the hell is going on with GLOBAL WARMING. The planet is freezing, the ice is building and the G.W. scientists are stuck-a total con job

<|endoftext|>
Temperature at record lows in many parts of the country. 50 degrees below zero with wind chill in large area. Global warming folks iced in!
<|endoftext|>
In the upcoming New Year we will focus like never before - if we do that we will have complete and total VICTORY in all we do!
<|endoftext|>
We're coming up on the NEW YEAR-It is really important that, despite so many stupid decisions being made in Washington, we make it BEST EVER
<|endoftext|>
The global warming  scientists don't want to be airlifted off the ship-they are having too much fun and that is too simple a solution-FAME!
<|endoftext|>
We should be focused on clean and beautiful air-not expensive and business closing GLOBAL WARMING-a total hoax!
<|endoftext|>
The rescue icebreaker, trying to free the ship of the GLOBAL WARMING scientists, has turned back-the ice is  massive (a record). IRONIC!

Will be working with contractors at Trump National Doral in Miami today.

Entrepreneurs: Put everything you've got into what you're doing. Be totally focused--nothing should be haphazard.
<|endoftext|>
Entrepreneurs: Whatever happens, you're responsible. If it doesn't happen, you're responsible.
<|endoftext|>
Entrepreneurs: Apply your skills and talent, but above all, be tenacious. See yourself as victorious--which means never giving up.
<|endoftext|>
ALWAYS TRY TO LEARN FROM OTHER PEOPLES MISTAKES, NOT YOUR OWN - IT IS MUCH CHEAPER THAT WAY!
<|endoftext|>
SOMETIMES YOUR BEST INVESTMENTS ARE THE ONES YOU DON'T MAKE!
<|endoftext|>
Did you ever not do something that had you done it would have turned out to be a disaster. Never look back, just learn from your experience!
<|endoftext|>
Realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort. You're in charge--everything starts with you.
<|endoftext|>
Entrepreneurs: Be ready for problems--you'll have them every day. Keep open to new ideas--that's where innovation begins.
<|endoftext|>
#3.  Look at the solution, not the problem. Learn to focus on what will give results.
<|endoftext|>
#2.  Keep your momentum. Without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere.
<|endoftext|>
#1. Keep the big picture in mind. There are always opportunities and possibilities, and thinking too small can negate a lot of them.

That was a great football game.

Wow, the ObamaCare website, which President Obama said would be working TODAY, is a total mess with many functions not even thought about!
<|endoftext|>
Just left $259 million rebuilding of Doral in Miami. Amazing - Trump National Doral will be a masterpiece (if I do say so myself)!

Despite the fact that I have had great success with the words YOU'RE FIRED, I do not like firing people. But ZERO on ObamaCare mess-no way!
<|endoftext|>
Why doesn't President Obama simply apologize for telling a big fat lie, announce that ObamaCare was a mistake, and deal a really great plan!
<|endoftext|>
US froze $8B in Iranian assets during ’79 Hostage Crisis. Now Obama is giving it back to Iran while Christian Pastor is jailed. Don't do it!
<|endoftext|>
Happy Thanksgiving to all--even the haters and losers!
<|endoftext|>
Tell Iran to let our Christian Pastor go--and I mean right now. If they don't, there will be hell to pay.

The $1B failed website is the tip of the iceberg on the ObamaCare. Over 90 million estimated will lose their plans next year.
<|endoftext|>
Mr. President, tell Iran to immediately free the CHRISTIAN PASTOR, as a sign of good faith, &amp, if they refuse break off talks--big sanctions
<|endoftext|>
President Obama said, over and over again, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, PERIOD! This turned out to be a total lie-90 mill.
<|endoftext|>
Look at the solution, not the problem. Learn to focus on what will give results.
<|endoftext|>
Set the example. You can motivate others as well as yourself by remembering that you are setting the example.
<|endoftext|>
How does Obama rationalize giving Iran $8B in sanction relief when a Christian pastor is being tortured in an Iranian prison?
<|endoftext|>
When do we sue the company-- for billions-- that robbed us in creating the hapless ObamaCare website?

I can't believe no one has been fired over the ObamaCare website fiasco!

I know it has been many years since our country made great deals, but isn't it about time we start, right now. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
The reason great dealmakers do not OPENLY celebrate a deal, especially one that is not complete, is that it shows weakness to the other side

John Kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with Iran. Great dealmakers do not celebrate deals,they just go on to the next one

How far has the United States gone down when we are reduced to accept the imbecilic deal just agreed to with Iran. Read THE ART OF THE DEAL!
<|endoftext|>
What a rotten deal we made with Iran. We get nothing (except laughter at our stupidity). They get everything, including delay and big cash!
<|endoftext|>
They changed the name global warming to climate change because the concept of global warming just wasn't working!
<|endoftext|>
The people that gave you global warming are the same people that gave you ObamaCare!

Snow and ice, freezing weather, in Texas, Arizona and Oklahoma - what the hell is going on with GLOBAL WARMING?

Get smart on knockout assaults and crime - we have to be slightly more vicious (and violent) than the assaulter-and crime would end FAST!
<|endoftext|>
The scum that gets high on badly hurting old ladies and others through knockout assaults wouldn't feel that way with a gun at their head!

Thomas Jefferson wrote the Senate filibuster rule. Harry Reid &amp, Obama killed it yesterday.  Rule was in effect for over 200 years.

If JP Morgan took their case through the courts for 15 years, nobody would be suing them—easy target.

"Weak newscasters are asking ""is there a racial component to knockout attacks?"" Of course there is and weakness will only make it worse!"
<|endoftext|>
If you are lucky enough to catch a knockout assaulter before getting slugged, and you carry a gun, shoot the bastard (teach them a lesson)!
<|endoftext|>
Knockout assaults are the new rage by sick and depraved youth. We better start getting tough in this country-and they want to take our guns!

It is crucial for Republicans to remain united during this shutdown
<|endoftext|>
There have been 17 shutdowns since 1976, 14 under Reagan and Bush with Democrat Congresses who wanted more spending.
<|endoftext|>
Obama has not passed a single budget in 4 years. Democrats don’t even vote them in Congress. He has failed to lead!
<|endoftext|>
Obama &amp, the Democrats want this shutdown. They think it helps their electoral prospects for 2014. Don’t believe!

With proper thinking and leadership, we can have a much better plan than Obamacare - something that works for the people and costs much less

Obamacare is far toooo expensive, far toooo complicated (thousands of pages) and, most importantly, doesn't work. WE CAN DO MUCH BETTER!

Our country and it's leadership has to be so careful and so smart - these are treacherous times, like no other. The world is a crazy place!

Thank you to all of my Twitter followers for helping to defeat Weiner and Spitzer. Remember, in the beginning they said it couldn't be done!

<|endoftext|>
Wow, Eliot Spitzer has lost - great news for New York City!

Bottom line, I don't think President changed people's minds - must hope for a lifeline from Putin, a very dangerous lifeline at that!

<|endoftext|>
In war, the elememt of surprise is sooooo important.What the hell is Obama doing.
<|endoftext|>
We have given Syria so much time and information-there has never been such an instance in wartime history. Syria is now fully prepared!
<|endoftext|>
Why isn't the Arab League paying for everything and sending troops? They want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves!
<|endoftext|>
The Arab League stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on Syria, but they want us to attack.Are our leaders insane or just stupid
<|endoftext|>
"It is truly amateur hour at the White House - and this is why we should not be doing the ""war thing"" right now!"
<|endoftext|>
President Obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on Syria!
<|endoftext|>
Did anyone notice that Obama failed to get a coalition of other countries to go along with us. He couldn't even get Britain! NO LEADERSHIP.
<|endoftext|>
Be prepared, there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into World War III.

<|endoftext|>
If we are going to continue to be stupid and go into Syria (watch Russia), as they say in the movies, SHOOT FIRST AND TALK LATER!
<|endoftext|>
I wonder what the great generals like Patton, the big M, or Robert E. LEE would have thought about our stupid broadcasting of an attack?
<|endoftext|>
That said, the rich Arab countries should get involved with the Syrian mess, not us.We should start rebuilding our own country &amp, military.
<|endoftext|>
Why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack Syria. Why can't we just be quiet and, if we attack at all, catch them by surprise?
<|endoftext|>
I give the President's speech a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10! Not bad but room for improvement!

<|endoftext|>
Why did lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman come to my office on numerous occasions begging for campaign contributions? Also, recent asks?
<|endoftext|>
Why is it that Eric Schneiderman is considered a lightweight by so many and has failed to go after Jon Corzine and big abusers for billions?
<|endoftext|>
Why did failing A.G. Eric Schneiderman, after years of looking, file his pathetic lawsuit on a SATURDAY afternoon (unheard of)? No case!

With the two wacko perverts--Spitzer and Weiner--NYC politics has become a joke all over the world.

Spitzer never made 10 cents on his own-he worked for his very rich father (a friend of mine who never thought much of Eliot as a businessman

I AM PLEASED TO INFORM YOU THAT CELEBRITY APPRENTICE HAS BEEN RENEWED FOR ANOTHER SEASON BY NBC. SEE YOU AT THE NBC UPFRONTS TOMORROW.
<|endoftext|>
You will love Celebrity Apprentice tonight - 9 PM on NBC. Must watch from beginning - two early firings!
<|endoftext|>
Two people fired very early on Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9 leading up to next weeks live Finale. Don't get angry at me tonight!
<|endoftext|>
The success of Shark Tank over the years is a total joke compared to the success of The Apprentice, one of the biggest hits in T.V. history.
<|endoftext|>
The Apprentice, on the other hand, has been a MAJOR television hit, often times finishing #1. Even now, after 13 seasons, it wins its slot!

A Warren Buffett corp. is currently ensnared in a bankruptcy. Likewise Icahn, Kravis, Apollo and many others have played the game.Thanks!

Jodi thought she outsmarted the system - it didn't work!  Congratulations to the jury on a job well done!  Now, will it be life or death?
<|endoftext|>
Man, we had a great day today at Trump Tower - lots of money was given to many people who really needed it - good feelings and happiness!
<|endoftext|>
Sorry losers and haters, but my I.Q. is one of the highest -and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure,it's not your fault

I just gave lots of money away at Trump Tower to people who needed it...they were very happy and appreciative!
<|endoftext|>
It's go time! See you at Trump Tower. I'm giving money away! #FundAnything
<|endoftext|>
People do not assume this but more than anything else, I like helping people. Be at Trump Tower at 11 AM today.
<|endoftext|>
Residential Capital, a company in which Warren Buffett is involved, went bankrupt - but that doesn't mean that Warren Buffett went bankrupt!
<|endoftext|>
I'm giving away money! 11AM Trump Tower. Be there or be left behind!
<|endoftext|>
I would absolutely kill Jon Stewart(?) in a debate - it would be no contest - he's not fast enough or smart enough (only obnoxious enough!).
<|endoftext|>
Just watched Jon Stewart(?) jumping up and down and screaming like a madman - nothing funny or smart, just loud and obnoxious, a pushy dope!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, I love stimulating debate and driving certain people crazy-the Generals were forced to do something they didn't want to do (not me).
<|endoftext|>
Is it even slightly possible that Jodi Arias could be set free-wow, what a miscarriage of justice that would be!
<|endoftext|>
The jury in the Jodi Arias trial is, believe it or not, still out. You never know but such a long deliberation could be good for the defense
<|endoftext|>
The Generals and top military brass never wanted a mixer but were forced to do it by very dumb politicians who wanted to be politically C!
<|endoftext|>
26,000 unreported sexual assults in the military-only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men &amp, women together?

<|endoftext|>
Tired of being bullied by the economy? I'm going to help people. Wednesday 11 AM at Trump Tower
<|endoftext|>
Keep Wednesday morning free. You will want to see this!
<|endoftext|>
26,000 sexual assaults or rapes reported in military last year-and that is just the number that is reported (many do not want to report).
<|endoftext|>
Sexual assault and rape in the Armed Forces is a Massive problem that nobody wants to talk about or do anything about-the big dark secret!
<|endoftext|>
Head of Air Force's anti-sexual assault unit arrested for sexual assault! It just seems that our Country is not what it used to be.

Time magazine should name David Pecker of American Media to be its top guy...but they are not smart enough to do that!
<|endoftext|>
If Jon Stewart is so above it all &amp, legit, why did he change his name from Jonathan Leibowitz? He should be proud of his heritage!
<|endoftext|>
What’s funny about the name “F**kface Von Clownstick” -- it was not coined by Jon Leibowitz-- he stole it from some moron on twitter.
<|endoftext|>
Amazing how the haters &amp, losers keep tweeting the name “F**kface Von Clownstick” like they are so original &amp, like no one else is doing it...

Why are some more concerned with granting terrorist rights than protecting innocent Americans?
<|endoftext|>
Our trade deficit is still on pace to be over $500B.  This is killing our manufacturing sector and sending jobs overseas.
<|endoftext|>
With Boston terrorist cell widening in suspects, it's now clear that it was a mistake to read the bomber the Miranda warning so early.
<|endoftext|>
Jodi, if you're listening, MAKE A DEAL!
<|endoftext|>
Jodi should try but the Govt. should not make a deal - no jury could be dumb enough to let her off (but you never know, look at OJ &amp, others)
<|endoftext|>
Jodi Arias has stated that she follows me on twitter so I really hate to be saying that she is guilty but sadly, she is as guilty as it gets
<|endoftext|>
Just took a look at Time Magazine-looks really flimsy like a free handout at a parking lot! The sad end is coming-just like Newsweek!

Snow and freezing weather all over mid-section of Country. Global warming specialists better start thinking fast!

Money is really cheap so this is a great time to buy a house-but be sure to lock in long term financing (without which don't buy).

Doing Fox and Friends at 7.00 A.M.  Hope you loved Apprentice last night.

Did you agree with my decision? #CelebApprentice

Boardroom time- which team do you think had the best presentation? #CelebApprentice
<|endoftext|>
Thanks for the tremendous support for my shirts, ties and suits at Macy's. They do great because of really high quality at a low price.
<|endoftext|>
The Time Magazine list of the 100 Most Influential People is a joke and stunt of a magazine that will, like Newsweek,soon be dead. Bad list!

What apology, didn't they go around beating the crap out of people and robbing them? Why did they all confess? Aren't police convinced?

Does Bush’s library have a wing featuring Supreme Court Justice Jon Robert’s ObamaCare ruling? Roberts was his prize appointee!

We need another Bush in office about as much as we need Obama to have a 3rd term.  No more Bushes!
<|endoftext|>
After tearing W Bush down for 12 years, now the media loves him. Why not? He gave them Obama.
<|endoftext|>
Weiner says many more pictures may be out there—this is just what NYC needs, a pervert Mayor.

Wow, I’m at 2,200,000  followers but I’d love to get rid of the haters &amp, losers—they’re such a waste of time!

<|endoftext|>
Can someone explain to me how a Chechnyan permanent resident non-citizen in our country is planning Jihad while on welfare?
<|endoftext|>
The Boston killer applying today for ObamaCare. He demands that medical bills be taken care of immediately. Does this include dental?
<|endoftext|>
As everybody knows, but the haters &amp, losers refuse to acknowledge, I do not wear a “wig.” My hair may not be perfect but it’s mine.
<|endoftext|>
The mother of the Boston killers (not suspects) says her boys are totally innocent and were set up-I can see the 14 year long defense now!
<|endoftext|>
Lance Armstrong just got sued by the Federal Government-they want their money back-I told you so! What was he thinking when he did that int?
<|endoftext|>
Scotland does not have free press, even when you are just stating the facts-it's crazy!
<|endoftext|>
I have many great people but also an amazing number of haters and losers responding to my tweets-why do these lowlifes follow-nothing to do!
<|endoftext|>
In light of Boston, immigration legislation will be much harder to get.
<|endoftext|>
The Central Park Five documentary  was a one sided piece of garbage that didn't explain the.horrific crimes of these young men while in park
<|endoftext|>
The Chinese talk of climate change and carbon footprint but don't clean up their factories-but they sell us the equipment to clean up ours!
<|endoftext|>
Wrong, used to be called global warming and when that name didn't work, they deftly changed it to climate change-because it's freezing!
<|endoftext|>
Did the Boston terrorists register their guns? No. Another example of why gun control legislation is not the answer!
<|endoftext|>
I’ve always been a fan of Steve Jobs, especially after watching Apple stock collapse w/out him – but the yacht he built is truly ugly.

It’s freezing in New York—where the hell is global warming?

If your enemies end up liking you it’s because they beat you.  You want their respect, not their friendship.
<|endoftext|>
Next time you are waiting in an emergency room remember the Boston killer was rushed to intensive care within minutes of capture.
<|endoftext|>
Will Barack Obama personally read the Boston terrorist his Miranda Rights?
<|endoftext|>
The Boston killer will soon be asking for a Presidential pardon—don’t give it to him, Mr. President—hang tough!
<|endoftext|>
Me, by a lot!
<|endoftext|>
Will be doing Fox and Friends at 7 A.M. (in 20 minutes).
<|endoftext|>
What did you think of the boardroom? #CelebApprentice
<|endoftext|>
George also appeared on Saturday Night Live when I was guest host in 2004. A great time! #CelebApprentice
<|endoftext|>
George Ross and I have done some great real estate deals together. He’s a tough negotiator. #CelebApprentice
<|endoftext|>
Romance or Adventure- what do you prefer? #CelebApprentice
<|endoftext|>
For you newcomers, George Ross was one of my first advisors on the original Apprentice. #CelebApprentice
<|endoftext|>
This assignment has been a challenge to both teams. #CelebApprentice
<|endoftext|>
I hope you are watching the Apprentice...tonight's show is great and Brett Michaels is back!
<|endoftext|>
What do you think of water boarding the Boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well? I suspect he may talk!
<|endoftext|>
"Make the Boston killer talk before our doctors make him better. Once he is well he will say, ""speak to my lawyers."""
<|endoftext|>
Don't forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9pm...you will love it!
<|endoftext|>
I don't know how Al Michaels could have been drunk and arrested on Friday night if he was totally sharp on Saturday morning.
<|endoftext|>
Great sportscaster Al Michaels, a friend of mine, played golf with me on Saturday morning at Trump National, LA. He was in perfect shape!
<|endoftext|>
If the Boston killer applies for Obama Care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand!
<|endoftext|>
NO MERCY TO TERRORISTS you dumb bastards!
<|endoftext|>
Can you imagine the Boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms, legs and worse!
<|endoftext|>
Bullshit-Pop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money (split between brothers and sisters) and I built it into over 9 bill.
<|endoftext|>
Watch Gary B tonight on Celebrity Apprentice-some really crazy things happen!
<|endoftext|>
Getting back to the nicer and more normal parts of life, Celebrity Apprentice is great tonight on NBC at 9. It will be a full two hour show!
<|endoftext|>
You are right, the media is always offending Donald Trump-they have no limits-but they will do anything not to offend the Boston killer!
<|endoftext|>
I know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually I'm a very compassionate person (with a very high IQ) with strong common sense
<|endoftext|>
Didn't the Boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away?  We are not dealing with an innocent baby here-DEATH
<|endoftext|>
When the stupid people start feeling sorry for the Boston killer and want to release him and give him medals, remember the killings-maimings
<|endoftext|>
"I hate when the news media, so afraid to offend anyone, always refers to the BOSTON KILLER as ""the suspect""."
<|endoftext|>
The shirts and ties at Macy's are so good-beautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piece-l kicked his ass
<|endoftext|>
I just won a big Court decision (N.Y. Post) against some character who claimed I owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties.
<|endoftext|>
Oh no, they are worried that they didn't read the Boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument. 12 year case to finish?  t
<|endoftext|>
Sorry,  the best and most beautiful ties and shirts made anywhere and at a really reasonable cost. Also, fragrance is amazing. GO TO MACY'S.
<|endoftext|>
Great job by the FBI, Boston Police and all others involved-start the trial tonight!
<|endoftext|>
Is the Boston killer eligible for Obama Care to bring him back to health?
<|endoftext|>
Read my tweets you dopes-of course he should get a trial-but fast (not a 12 year disaster).
<|endoftext|>
You must be kidding-zero chance he is innocent!
<|endoftext|>
Get ALL the info,  then quick trial, then death penalty for the Boston killer of innocent children and people! Do not be kind.
<|endoftext|>
Lots of comments—Do you really believe these two brothers operated alone without influence of others?
<|endoftext|>
These Tsarnaev brothers did not work alone. They had help and assistance from other cell members. Be vigilant and on the lookout.

<|endoftext|>
The reality is that no gun bill will ever stop tragedies.  And as we have learned from ObamaCare, Washington only makes things worse!
<|endoftext|>
Thinking small when you could think big limits you in all aspects of your life.
<|endoftext|>
It is terrible that neither Obama, Biden nor Kerry attended Lady Thatcher’s funeral. They would all run to Muslim Brotherhood Morsi’s.
<|endoftext|>
Business is easy. Dealing with people is hard. If you are an entrepreneur, your most important job is to choose who works with you.
<|endoftext|>
The Chinese must still be laughing at Kerry’s trip to China.  He got nothing, gave them everything and promised even more.
<|endoftext|>
I sure hope the sexting pervert Anthony Weiner runs for mayor.  Will be great fun watching him both lose and be humiliated.
<|endoftext|>
Negotiation is persuasion more than power. Be reasonable and flexible, and never let anyone know exactly where you’re coming from.
<|endoftext|>
The world economy is under deep stress with growth slowing everywhere.  Yet crude is over $87/barrel. Should be $25 at the most.
<|endoftext|>
It’s very sad that the administration isn’t sending anyone to Margaret Thatcher’s funeral. She was a big U.S. supporter.
<|endoftext|>
We must change the laws of our land and seek fair but rapid trials for the perpetrators of terrorist acts (Boston) with harsh punishment!
<|endoftext|>
My heart goes out to the people of Boston on this terrible day!
<|endoftext|>
Will be doing Fox and Friends in two minutes!
<|endoftext|>
Do you think I made the right decision? #CelebApprentice
<|endoftext|>
Who do you think is going home? #CelebApprentice
<|endoftext|>
Product integration is very important. #CelebApprentice
<|endoftext|>
I’m impressed -- both teams have produced very entertaining silent films. #CelebApprentice
<|endoftext|>
Based on the shoots- which silent film do you think will be better? #CelebApprentice
<|endoftext|>
What would you choose- Vampires or Cavemen? #CelebApprentice
<|endoftext|>
Get ready to turn to NBC for CELEBRITY APPRENTICE -- TONIGHT'S SHOW IS GREAT!
<|endoftext|>
Make sure to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at  9 on NBC. A GREAT SHOW, JUST LIKE THE MASTERS.   9
<|endoftext|>
Remember, save your evening to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9 - increased to a full two hours - great episode - watch Gary B.
<|endoftext|>
South Korea must in some form pay for our help-the U.S. must stop being stupid!
<|endoftext|>
China will extract much from Secretary Kerry and the U:S. in order for them to help us with the North Korea problem-don't let this happen!
<|endoftext|>
Did A Rod really try to buy the papers that would implicate him re. drugs - wow, that would be the end, a disaster!
<|endoftext|>
Remember, NBC increased Celebrity Apprentice to 2 hours starting this Sunday night at 9 P.M. through end of season-great news for App lovers
<|endoftext|>
What a shame that Kobe Bryant was so badly injured last night - a truly great champion who brought the Lakers back from oblivion this year!
<|endoftext|>
Ridiculous that they gave the 14 year old golfer from China a one stroke penalty for slow play at The Masters(see, I can stick up for China)
<|endoftext|>
I am on David Letterman tonight.
<|endoftext|>
Our country should be worried about nuclear control far more than gun control--&amp, that one's not even close!
<|endoftext|>
Remember to take time this weekend to relax and regroup. It will pay major dividends for the next week.

Where is the President?  It is time for him to come on TV and show strength against the repeated threats from North Korea -- and others.
<|endoftext|>
The only American who has met with the North Korean man child is Dennis Rodman.  Isn’t that frightening and sad?
<|endoftext|>
China controls North Korea. So now besides cyber hacking us all day, they are using the Norks to taunt us.  China is a major threat.
<|endoftext|>
Don't talk to me about Bush, I was never a defender or a fan!
<|endoftext|>
I can't believe we are not asking South Korea for anything. They make a fortune on us while we spend a fortune defending them-how stupid!
<|endoftext|>
“Interested is interesting. If you remember that simple rule, you will have no trouble making conversation.”- Think Like a Billionaire
<|endoftext|>
Mr. President, it is time to lead on the Korean crisis.  Make a statement from the Rose Garden and send a strong message to the man child!

<|endoftext|>
I hope everyone (especially the haters and losers) goes to Macy's today and buys some DJT ties, shirts and suits-and SUCCESS Fragrance-love!
<|endoftext|>
Sorry losers and haters, but I LOVED the great energy in Madison Square Garden during my speech. The WWE thought it was incredible - it was!
<|endoftext|>
Why did Vince and the WWE give my speech and segment the most time last night on USA Network - because that's what people want to see!
<|endoftext|>
Yea, NBC has increased all remaining Celebrity Apprentice episodes to two hours starting at 9 P.M. on Sunday!  Amazing show.

Don't negate your own power. Whatever you've been dealt, know you can deal with it. Fear is the opposite of faith.
<|endoftext|>
Think positively. There are always opportunities. Keep your focus and don't give up!

The new reality. ‘China Daily’ is sold in street newspaper vending machines across DC. Why not? They own the place.

Margaret Thatcher was the Iron Lady of the West. She promoted freedom &amp, democracy---a great leader &amp, ally of America.
<|endoftext|>
What do you think so far? #CelebApprentice
<|endoftext|>
Dennis Rodman is a project manager tonight on Celebrity Apprentice - watch Dennis in full action!
<|endoftext|>
Starting next week, and by popular demand (plus good ratings) NBC will broadcast only two hour episodes of Celebrity Apprentice at 9 P.M.
<|endoftext|>
My induction last night at Madison Square Garden into the WWE Hall of Fame was amazing-I met some great people, including Bruno.
<|endoftext|>
True, America is rapidly losing it's SPIRIT, and when that's gone, we will only be going in one direction - and that direction is down!
<|endoftext|>
China is pushing North Korea!
<|endoftext|>
When is South Korea going to start paying us for the massive amounts of money we are spending to protect them from the North?
<|endoftext|>
Our President must be very careful with the 28 year old wack job in North Korea. At some point we may have to get very tough-blatant threats
<|endoftext|>
I'm getting ready to be inducted tonight into the WWE Hall of Fame at Madison Square Garden - a great honor for me and the Trump family!
<|endoftext|>
I am doing On the Record With Greta Van Susteren at 10 P.M. on Fox. We will be talking about the bad economy and other subjects of interest!

Only 88,000 jobs were added this past March. Prediction was 190,000. Businesses can’t expand with Obama Care &amp, high taxes on horizon.

No, I'm saying that the World is paying the price for China's pollution while they make a fortune with their dirty factories! Very sad.
<|endoftext|>
Major article in New York Times today discusses the cost of environmental damage in China and how it is RAPIDLY GROWNG! Rest of World pays.
<|endoftext|>
China is the biggest environmental polluter in the World, by far. They do nothing to clean up their factories and laugh at our stupidity!
<|endoftext|>
We have tremendous economic power over China if our leaders knew how to use it, which they don't! China's economy would collapse without us.
<|endoftext|>
What do we get from our economic competitor South Korea for the tremendous cost of protecting them from North Korea? - NOTHING!
<|endoftext|>
North Korea is reliant on China. China could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders.

Haters, stop saying I went bankrupt, it is not so. I never went bankrupt...
<|endoftext|>
... but like many other great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage.
<|endoftext|>
For the haters, out of hundreds of deals or transactions, I have used the bankruptcy laws 4 times in order to cut better deals.
<|endoftext|>
Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool...
<|endoftext|>
... Icahn, Kravis, Apollo and most others--but nobody says they went bankrupt!
<|endoftext|>
People buy deals &amp, immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals...

Omarosa is very confident that the execs loved her concept &amp, presentation.
<|endoftext|>
Next she says she's being set up by Omarosa to fail....is somebody confused?
<|endoftext|>

Karl Rove’s stupid ad made Ashley Judd hot—now everybody is talking about her.
<|endoftext|>
Ashley Judd has just thanked Karl Rove for all the attention he has given her—unreal!—how stupid can we get?
<|endoftext|>
If Mitch McConnell wants to win his election, he’d better get rid of jinxed Karl Rove and fast...
<|endoftext|>

Our leaders are terrible. The government spends over $50B a day.  It can’t find cuts for less than 2 days of spending?! Sad!
<|endoftext|>
The $85B sequester is just 2% of Obama's $3.5T record deficit spending budget.  Our leaders are ruining our children's future.

Obama is making speeches excoriating the Republicans, and they never answer back. Why aren’t they fighting?
<|endoftext|>
An individual, whose whole career is trying to take down successful celebrities with nonsense campaigns, has turned his attention to me.....

...So far, he has been a complete failure at doing so. He should read The Art of the Deal and use his energy to focus on a new career.

I'm saying that the Tea Party, perhaps by another name, will soon have another big moment- and will be a major factor in victory!

Why didn't movie Lincoln use Ford's Theater for big scene instead of the stage of an unrelated theater?
<|endoftext|>
Big response to my Tea Party statement-remember they were never fully energized by Romney campaign and will have far more power with time.

One positive from last week for Lance was that everyone was focused on Manti Te'o!  Why did Lance do that interview?
<|endoftext|>
Republicans are always worried about their general approval. With proposing to 'ignore the debt ceiling' they are ignoring their base.
<|endoftext|>
The worst negotiators in history (otherwise known as Republicans) have just offered to suspend debt ceiling for four months. Pathetic!
<|endoftext|>
You must promise that you will never cheat off Manti Te’o’s test papers.
<|endoftext|>
Part of Obama’s new-found confidence is that the Republicans aren’t using their power of ideas properly or effectively.
<|endoftext|>
Obama’s speech indicates he wants to change this country as we know it--wow, he really feels emboldened.
<|endoftext|>
If the Republicans need a chief negotiator I am always available--or can recommend some really good ones!
<|endoftext|>
Republicans, don’t extend the debt ceiling—make the great deal now!

"I'll bet Lance Armstrong wishes he didn't do the interview with Oprah-- he's saying to himself ""what was I thinking?"""
<|endoftext|>
Brent Musburger did himself a great favor by saying what everyone was thinking- he is much more popular now than before.
<|endoftext|>
IMO--- Manti Te’o was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the Heisman Trophy.
<|endoftext|>
Can it just be new age that Manti Te’o fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax?
<|endoftext|>
Not believable that Manti Te’o was in love for one year with a girl he never met- she then died. He is either very stupid....
<|endoftext|>
...or mentally troubled (or a con).
<|endoftext|>
Look, I have always liked Lance Armstrong- I just hated what he did to himself, including recently. His life will now be hell.

Lance Armstrong made a really big mistake by opening up to Oprah. I’ll bet he wishes he had the chance to do it over again.

I am no fan of Bill Cosby but never-the-less some free advice - if you are innocent, do not remain silent. You look guilty as hell!

“If you like your plan you keep it.” = “Gruber is just some adviser.” Two of Obama’s greatest lies told to the American public.
<|endoftext|>
“Get in. Get it done. Get it done right. Get out.” – Fred C. Trump (My father!)
<|endoftext|>
For those that constantly say that “global warming” is now “climate change”—they changed the name. The name global warming wasn’t working
<|endoftext|>
"There are many Jonathan Gruber types selling the global warming ""stuff"" - and they really do believe the American public is stupid."
<|endoftext|>
Entrepreneurs: always remember that deals are fluid. Terms are always negotiable and time can be the best option for success.
<|endoftext|>
ObamaCare will continue to stop entrepreneurship, slow growth and halt research &amp, development. Defund, Repeal &amp, Replace!
<|endoftext|>
“Remember that some things are worth waiting for. Plans can change, sometimes for good reason.” – Trump Never Give Up
<|endoftext|>
At least ObamaCare/RomneyCare architect Gruber admitted, albeit privately, that we were lied to by Obama. Gang of Liars.
<|endoftext|>
Just like Jonathan Gruber viciously lied &amp, called Americans “stupid” on ObamaCare, many consultants are doing the same on Global Warming.
<|endoftext|>
Obama’s China ‘climate’ deal binds America with language of ‘will’ curb emissions now while China only ‘intends’ to curb in 2030. Bad deal!
<|endoftext|>
ObamaCare/RomneyCare architect Gruber was paid over $6M with our tax dollars yet Obama only claims he ‘was some adviser.’
<|endoftext|>
Deportations are now at a record low. Obama manipulated the numbers to lie to the public that they were at a record high. Secure the border!
<|endoftext|>
The entire country is  FREEZING - we desperately need a heavy dose of global warming, and fast! Ice caps size reaches all time high.
<|endoftext|>
. #LaskerRink.  We do not do the maintenance on Lasker Rink, that is done by NEW YORK CITY.
<|endoftext|>
So Obama's top people responsible for ObamaCare think the American Public is stupid! All based on lies and deception! Repubs should sue.
<|endoftext|>
Entrepreneurs: Set the bar high. Do the best you possibly can. Apply your skills and talent, but above all, be tenacious.

Entrepreneurs: Set the example. You can motivate others as well as yourself by remembering you are setting the example.

Entrepreneurs: See yourself as victorious. Look at the solution, not the problem. Keep your focus positive.

Remember, we don't get any oil from Iraq, China gets whatever ISIS hasn't already taken. So why isn't China sending the troops? Too smart!
<|endoftext|>
Do not go back into Iraq unless they agree, in a signed formal instrument, to give the U.S. 50% of their oil reserves.Make the deal dummies!
<|endoftext|>
We spent TWO TRILLION DOLLARS in Iraq and got NOTHING. Now we are going back and will again get NOTHING because our leaders are clueless!
<|endoftext|>
We are now sending thousands of additional troops to Iraq to teach them how to fight - they will run, billions wasted! WHAT DOES U.S. GET?
<|endoftext|>
We should immediately stop sending our beautiful American tax dollars to countries that hate us and laugh at our President’s stupidity!

The new Congress must restore military spending &amp, stop Obama budget cuts. Also, hold Obama accountable on the VA.
<|endoftext|>
Obama’s Amnesty Executive Order can now be stopped by Majority Leader McConnell with riders. That’s one reason we needed the Senate.
<|endoftext|>
Yesterday was a referendum on ObamaCare &amp, all other Obama fiascos. Republicans can now rein him in.
<|endoftext|>
Obama has now had two record &amp, historic midterm losses. There is Hope &amp, Change for America.
<|endoftext|>
A really bad night for President Obama. Now the Republicans have to get together and get the job done!
<|endoftext|>
One year ago I started calling President Obama INCOMPETENT and people thought it was too tough.     Tonight everyone is using that    word!
<|endoftext|>
Looking like a really big night for Republicans - a tremendous refutation of President Obama and his failed policies!
<|endoftext|>
Today the Democrats lose big. But tomorrow the Republicans must communicate a positive pro-growth agenda.
<|endoftext|>
Today is referendum on ObamaCare, Amnesty, slow growth, having your healthcare dropped &amp, all the other lies.
<|endoftext|>
Wow, so far everyone running for office who I did a ROBOCALL for has taken the lead in the polls -- the smart pols know this. GREAT!
<|endoftext|>
They finally let our Marine out of a Mexican prison, no thanks to Obama. Way too long. Such an event should never be allowed to happen again
<|endoftext|>
The five prisoners our government so stupidly released for one pathetic traitor are now fighting and killing for ISIS-BAD DEAL! Courtmarshal
<|endoftext|>
Having a truly great imagination is often far more important than having even massive knowledge - but still, never underestimate knowledge!
<|endoftext|>
Many of the released Guantanamo detainees are now fighting for ISIS and other enemy groups.We need proper leadership before it is too late!

Obama will quarantine all soldiers returning from Africa for 21 days. But he still allows all who contract Ebola into country? Hypocrite.

In game 7 of the World Series tonight, the Giants are making a big mistake in not starting their ace against K.C., even with two days rest.

Just out - the POLAR ICE CAPS are at an all time high, the POLAR BEAR population has never been stronger. Where the hell is global warming?

The U.S. rocket that blew-up and crashed yesterday is emblematic of the United States under Obama. Nothing works, be it a rocket or website.

President Obama strongly considering a plan to bring non-U.S. citizens with Ebola to the United States for treatment. Now I know he's nuts!
<|endoftext|>
Success requires 100% of your focus and 100% of your effort. Don't sell yourself short.

Yes, I won the right to have my name taken off Trump Plaza in A.C. because it was not operated up to a very high standard and NO involvement

With all that is happening with Ebola, including the doctor who so easily came back to New York, Obama still refuses to stop the flights!
<|endoftext|>
“Yesterday's home runs don't win today's games.” – Babe Ruth
<|endoftext|>
There is ZERO margin for error on Ebola. Are we confident in Obama when he can’t even make a website for $5 Billion?
<|endoftext|>
Canadian PM Harper immediately called the Ottawa attack terrorism. At least North America has a strong leader who lives in reality.
<|endoftext|>
The Ebola doctor who just flew to N.Y. from West Africa and went on the subway, bowling and dining is a very SELFISH man-should have known!
<|endoftext|>
President Obama, you are a complete and total disaster, but you have a chance to do something great and important: STOP THE FLIGHTS!
<|endoftext|>
President Obama has a major meeting on the N.Y.C. Ebola outbreak, with people flying in from all over the country, but decided to play golf!
<|endoftext|>
I never thought I'd say it in my lifetime, but President Barack Hussein Obama, aka Barry Sotoro, is a far worse president than Jimmy Carter!
<|endoftext|>
I have been saying for weeks for President Obama to stop the flights from West Africa. So simple, but he refused. A TOTAL incompetent!
<|endoftext|>
Ebola has been confirmed in N.Y.C., with officials frantically trying to find all of the people and things he had contact with.Obama's fault
<|endoftext|>
If this doctor, who so recklessly flew into New York from West Africa,has Ebola,then Obama should apologize to the American people &amp, resign!
<|endoftext|>
There is a good possibility that a person who treated patients in West Africa and who FLEW into New York has Ebola. Touched many, bedlam!
<|endoftext|>
Double digit premium increases because of ObamaCare. Dems trying to delay showing numbers until after election, but news is spreading fast!

<|endoftext|>
Why are we letting the three girls, who left the U.S. to join ISIS, back into the country? How stupid has our once respected country become!
<|endoftext|>
If there is one more Ebola case in the U.S., a full travel ban will be instituted. This common sense move should have been done long ago!
<|endoftext|>
The United States troops which were sent to West Africa have only gotten 4 hours of Ebola training - very unfair to them and their families!
<|endoftext|>
"The United States, under President Obama, has truly become the ""gang that couldn't shoot straight."" Everything he touches turns to garbage!"
<|endoftext|>
The U.S. accidentally air dropped a large shipment of military weapons and supplies right into the middle of ISIS as enemy laughs! Very sad!

Oscar Pistorious will likely only serve 10 months for the cold blooded murder of his girlfriend. Another O.J. travesty.The judge is a moron!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, one of the all-time greats in fashion, OSCAR DE LA RENTA, has just died at 82. Great fashion achievements but also a really nice guy!
<|endoftext|>
Oscar Pistorius only gets five years in prison for killing his girlfriend. Ridiculous decision! Judge couldn't even read her own writings.
<|endoftext|>
Has everyone forgotten our marine who now sits in a Mexican prison because we have a president too incompetent or too lazy to make a call?
<|endoftext|>
I was never a fan of Bush, in fact, he was so bad he gave us Obama! But Obama is truly a pathetic excuse of a president, can't get any worse

I just returned from Iowa - what a beautiful state. The people are amazing and the event for Congressman Steve King was a great success!
<|endoftext|>
"Do you believe Obama just said that America would be ""less safe"" with a travel ban from West Africa.This is the thinking of a total mad man!"
<|endoftext|>
"The lobbyist and political hack that President Obama just appointed as the ""Ebola Czar,"" just missed his first major meeting on Ebola-A joke"
<|endoftext|>
I'm leaving for Iowa now - will be great!
<|endoftext|>
If I were president Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi would be let out of jail with one phone call. If not,Mexico would pay a price like never before!

Do you think the 14 African nations that are banning West Africans from coming into their nations are being called racists? Perhaps not!
<|endoftext|>
"14 African nations have totally banned West Africans from entering their nations. Likewise many other nations. But the U.S. = ""COME ON IN"""
<|endoftext|>
Obama just appointed an Ebola Czar with zero experience in the medical area and zero experience in infectious disease control. A TOTAL JOKE!
<|endoftext|>
If you can’t see it, you can’t make it happen. Entrepreneurs, chase your dreams with resolute focus &amp, determination. Be positive!
<|endoftext|>
Now Michelle Nunn will not admit she voted for Obama. Of course she did. Nunn supports ObamaCare &amp, is anti-Second Amendment.
<|endoftext|>
The new Ebola czar will report to the WH &amp, NSA adviser Susan Rice. More mismanagement &amp, duplicity with CDC. Obama is terrible executive.
<|endoftext|>
Our president could not make a proper website with $5B. The website still does not work. How can we feel safe about Ebola?!
<|endoftext|>
Looks like Obama will not stop the very potentially dangerous flights to and from West Africa. What the hell is wrong with this guy?
<|endoftext|>
The Ebola nurse should NEVER have been allowed to fly to Cleveland and (amazing) back again. Nothing works in our once great country anymore
<|endoftext|>
I am starting to think that there is something seriously wrong with President Obama's mental health. Why won't he stop the flights. Psycho!
<|endoftext|>
It is time for the airline pilots, flight attendants and the airlines themselves to stop flights to and from West Africa. Do it right now!
<|endoftext|>
I just had a great victory against lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman. Most of his case re Trump U. was thrown out or gutted. Little remains
<|endoftext|>
I can't believe that Mitt Romney would run for president again. He had his chance and blew it in the last weeks of the race.
<|endoftext|>
A nurse in Dallas who treated Ebola patient Thomas Duncan was allowed to fly to Cleveland.She should never have been so allowed! The real JV
<|endoftext|>
"With all of the words President Obama just dispensed at his press conference, he didn't say what we all want to hear,""I'LL STOP THE FLIGHTS"""
<|endoftext|>
President Obama has a personal responsibility to visit &amp, embrace all people in the US who contract Ebola!
<|endoftext|>
Obama still refuses to stop the flights. Is he stubborn or just plain incompetent - I say both!
<|endoftext|>
We pay for Obama's travel so he can fundraise millions so Democrats can run on lies. Then we pay for his golf.

So many problems in the U.S. and leadership that is hopeless...and now, on top of everything else, we just hit $18 trillion in debt!

As ISIS and Ebola spread like wildfire, the Obama administration just submitted a paper on how to stop climate change (aka global warming).

Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter

Even though I refused to pay a ridiculous price for the Buffalo Bills, I would have produced a winner. Now that won’t happen.

<|endoftext|>
I will be on Fox &amp, Friends tomorrow morning at 7.00. Ebola and ISIS will be topics.
<|endoftext|>
I don't know if President Obama isn't stopping the flights from Ebola torn West Africa because he is stubborn, stupid, or just doesn't care!
<|endoftext|>
Here we go - A healthcare worker who treated Thomas Duncan, the man who flew into the U.S. from West Africa infected with Ebola, caught it!
<|endoftext|>
President Obama, NOW, bring our 4000 innocent and ill-trained soldiers home from West Africa, before it is too late, AND STOP THE FLIGHTS!
<|endoftext|>
Remember when I said when Saddam Hussein fell - the new leader of Iraq will be meaner and tougher and hate the U.S. even more. Welcome ISIS!
<|endoftext|>
If a conservative Republican made the mistake that Mrs. Obama just made by calling Braley by the wrong name, it would be the biggest story!
<|endoftext|>
Michelle Obama made a terrible mistake in Iowa. When endorsing Bruce Braley before a large crowd, she called him Bruce Bailey seven times.
<|endoftext|>
Isn't it ridiculous, starting today, new Ebola screenings go into effect for people coming from West Africa. Just stop the flights dummies!
<|endoftext|>
"""I've never seen anything like it, everything he touches turns to gold!""  So nice, a quote by Fred C.Trump about his son Donald (me!)."
<|endoftext|>
Do you notice that because of Ebola, ISIS etc., ObamaCare has gone to the back burner despite horrible results coming out. A disaster!
<|endoftext|>
Obama: “I will control Ebola.” = Obama: “If you like your health care plan, you can keep your healthcare plan.”
<|endoftext|>
Obama is making the Ebola problem much worse than it needs to be in the U.S. by not halting flights from West Africa. Airport testing a joke
<|endoftext|>
If you are interested in balancing work and pleasure, you will never succeed!
<|endoftext|>
I feel sorry for the 4000 soldiers who are being forced to go the West Africa to fight Ebola. Their families are up in arms. Not trained.
<|endoftext|>
Tens of millions of dollars in airstrikes had no impact because key leaders fled after hearing ON NEWS REPORTS the strikes were coming. DUMB
<|endoftext|>
"China is ripping wealth out Africa and yet, as usual, refuses to put anything back to help with Ebola. ""Let the stupid Americans do it!"" SAD"

The residential real estate market continues to provide opportunities for first time home owners. Buy now if you can!
<|endoftext|>
The CDC chief just said Ebola is spreading faster than Aids. Marines are preparing for a pandemic drill. Stop all flights from West Africa!
<|endoftext|>
Obama won’t send troops to fight jihadists, yet sends them to Liberia to contract Ebola. He is a delusional failure.
<|endoftext|>
Right now 4000 U.S. troops are stupidly heading to West Africa to help fight Ebola.No help from China, Russia or wealthy African oil nations
<|endoftext|>
“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.” – Walt Disney
<|endoftext|>
The U.S. is spending fortunes at airports checking people coming in from West Africa, with uncertain results. STOP THE FLIGHTS YOU DUMB B's!
<|endoftext|>
In a little reported event, China has just overtaken the United States as the NUMBER ONE World economic power! Great going Washington!
<|endoftext|>
Even Jimmy Carter just released a statement saying that Obama doesn't have a clue. That has to be a new low!
<|endoftext|>
Obama, stop the flights to and from West Africa NOW - before it is too late! Can't you see what's happening? Can you be that thick (stupid)?
<|endoftext|>
"Can you believe this fool, Dr. Thomas Frieden of CDC, just stated, ""anyone with fever should be asked if they have been in West Africa"" DOPE"

“Today's put-off objectives reduce tomorrow's achievements.” - Henry Banks

ISIS is advancing even against Obama’s airstrikes. Obama is disengaged and making the Middle East even more dangerous.
<|endoftext|>
Obamacare premiums continue to rise and bend up the cross curve. And the back-end of the website does not even work.
<|endoftext|>
Obama is looking like an incompetent fool in the handling of the war against.ISIS! Why isn't China and Russia helping - they gain so much!
<|endoftext|>
I was relentless because, more often than you would think, sheer persistence is the difference between success and failure. NEVER GIVE UP!

Kentucky has a chance to have the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, representing it in Washington. Big power for State. Don't blow it
<|endoftext|>
I can't believe Mitch McConnell isn't way up in the Kentucky polls. Massive seniority brings so much power and status to State. Brings K.$'s
<|endoftext|>
Despite the ever increasing Ebola disaster, Obama refuses to stop flights from West Africa.It's almost like he's saying F-you to U.S. public
<|endoftext|>
Obama has missed 58% of his intelligence briefings. But our president does make 100% of his fundraisers.
<|endoftext|>
I'm not going to be watching much NFL football anymore. Too time consuming, too boring, too many flags and too soft. Focus on other things!
<|endoftext|>
What the hell is Obama doing in allowing all of these potentially very sick people to continue entering the U.S.! Is he stupid or arrogant?
<|endoftext|>
I don't know what it is, but I'm getting totally bored watching NFL football. Too many penalties and far too soft! T.V. off and back to work
<|endoftext|>
The Jets just don't have it. Time for a quarterback change!
<|endoftext|>
President Obama, I have an idea! Pretend that West Africa is Israel and then you will be able to stop the Ebola area flights.
<|endoftext|>
President Obama - close down the flights from Ebola infected areas right now, before it is too late! What the hell is wrong with you?
<|endoftext|>
Something very important, and indeed society changing, may come out of the Ebola epidemic that will be a very good thing: NO SHAKING HANDS!
<|endoftext|>
This Ebola patient Thomas Duncan, who fraudulently entered the U.S. by signing false papers, is causing havoc. If he lives, prosecute!
<|endoftext|>
If Ebola is so non-contagious, how come an NBC cameraman caught it so quickly while over in West Africa? U.S. is behaving very foolishly!
<|endoftext|>
Can you believe that President Obama still hasn't stopped the flights and people pouring into the U.S. from West Africa. TERRIBLE PRESIDENT!
<|endoftext|>
Really interesting, President Obama was quick to shut down flights to Isreal but is totally unwilling to shut down flights from West Africa!
<|endoftext|>
Saw Michael Jordan and Ray Allen today playing golf at Trump National Doral, the Blue Monster. Great guys!
<|endoftext|>
Ebola patient Duncan lied on his exit papers by saying he never came into contact with a person with Ebola. He knew he did, and person died.
<|endoftext|>
How incompetent are our leaders allowing these Ebola infected people to come into our country with all of the problems and danger entailed!
<|endoftext|>
The Ebola patient who came into our country knew exactly what he was doing. Came into contact with over 100 people.Here we go-I told you so!
<|endoftext|>
The brand new hotel at Trump National Doral has the most beautiful rooms and suites in Miami.  Enjoy!
<|endoftext|>
I just arrived at Trump National Doral in Miami where I'll spend the day checking work just completed by contractors. This place is amazing!
<|endoftext|>
Ebola is much easier to transmit than the CDC and government representatives are admitting. Spreading all over Africa-and fast. Stop flights
<|endoftext|>
We have millions in our country unemployed yet we are wasting millions arming Syrian ‘rebels.’ What is wrong with Washington?!
<|endoftext|>
Obama can attend a fundraiser every day but can’t be bothered to get briefed on national security. Commander-in-Chief?!
<|endoftext|>
Our national security starts at the border. Do you think ISIS &amp, al-Qaeda are just in the Middle East?
<|endoftext|>
"How is ABC Television allowed to have a show entitled ""Blackish""? Can you imagine the furor of a show, ""Whiteish""! Racism at highest level?"
<|endoftext|>
Stop flights into the U.S. from West Africa immediately!
<|endoftext|>
The woman who is the Secret Service Director looks like she is way over her head.Why can't the president appoint the best and the brightest?
<|endoftext|>
The United States must immediately institute strong travel restrictions or Ebola will be all over the United States-a plague like no other!
<|endoftext|>
How dumb is our president to send thousands of poorly trained and ill-equipped soldiers over to West Africa to fight Ebola. Stop all flights
<|endoftext|>
Here we go! I stated long ago that we should cancel all flights from West Africa. Now we have Ebola in U.S., AND IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE!
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Can you believe that the U.S. will be sending 3000 troops to Africa to help with Ebola.They will come home infected? We have enough problems
<|endoftext|>
It is so sad to see what has happened to Atlantic City. So many bad decisions by the pols over the years - airport, convention center, etc.

I left Atlantic City years ago, good timing. Now I may buy back in, at much lower price,  to save Plaza &amp, Taj. They were run badly by funds!

Wow, Obama really put it to Israel by canceling flights there. This puts them at a tremendous disadvantage. Tourism and more will just stop.

What took so long to catch only 1 of the Benghazi terrorists? Especially after the killer has been taunting the US in the press f/2 yrs.

If anybody else but Coore and Crenshaw designed Pinehurst they would be run out of town—(and the turtleback greens are totally unfair)!

I have been very consistent and always said that Iraq would fall as soon as the U.S. left. What a terrible waste of lives and money!
<|endoftext|>
"Iran will convince our incompetent President that they are trying to help us with Iraq, take over the country &amp, oil, and ""O"" will say thanks"
<|endoftext|>
Turnberry in Scotland is a far superior golf course to Pinehurst - and it isn't even close! Likewise the Blue Monster at Doral.
<|endoftext|>
Iran is moving troops into Iraq under the guise that it is helping out. Actually, they will take over Iraq and all of their oil. Stupid U.S.

Obama can release 5 senior Taliban for a deserter but can’t make Mexico release decorated Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi. Pathetic

President said we would never leave a soldier behind. How about the 4 who died in Benghazi?
<|endoftext|>
Great deal, we swap 5 killer terrorists for a U.S. military deserter. That’s how the U.S. negotiates nowadays.
<|endoftext|>
Bowe Bergdahl walked off the base after he was told not to. Solders died looking for him. U.S. should NEVER have made the deal! PUNISHMENT?
<|endoftext|>
Only a grossly incompetent government led by an equally incompetent president could have made the terrible trade for Bergdahl. #OrangeRoom
<|endoftext|>
That the Obama administration didn't know the facts about who Bergdahl was before making the stupid 5 killers for one trade is pathetic!

The statement about leaving the base came directly from CBS Evening News.
<|endoftext|>
At some point Sgt. Bergdahl will have to explain his capture. In 2009 he simply wandered off his base without a weapon. Many questions!
<|endoftext|>
The U.S. cannot negotiate with terrorists. It is a sad and terrible situation for the family involved, but this can only lead to disaster.
<|endoftext|>
President Obama created a VERY BAD precedent by handing over five Taliban prisoners in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Another U.S. loss!

Now that the ObamaCare website contractor has been terminated for obvious incompetence, is the person who hired them going to be fired?

President Obama just fired the ObamaCare website builder. My question is, why were they hired in the first place? Sue them for damages!

The news about our beautiful Miss Venezuela, Monica Spear, is devastating to all who knew her. A spectacular woman, she will be missed.
<|endoftext|>
Tomorrow is the 10 year anniversary of the Apprentice, one of the biggest hits in television history. How time flies!
<|endoftext|>
Why didn’t Gates resign if he was so unhappy about what he was being told by Obama? The fact is, Iraq etc. have always been disasters!

While I am a critic of President Obama, I hate it when someone (Robert Gates) writes a self serving negative book about his boss.

I would like to wish everyone A HAPPY AND HEALTHY NEW YEAR. WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO, FINALLY, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Do you believe that The State Department, on NEW YEAR'S EVE, just released more of Hillary's e-mails. They just want it all to end. BAD!
<|endoftext|>
A GREAT day in South Carolina. Record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm. This is now a movement to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Iowa was fantastic last night, amazing crowd and people. I'm now in Florida, getting ready to go to South Carolina. Big crowd, very exciting
<|endoftext|>
The great people of New Hampshire, who I love, are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper.

So, I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million &amp, done. Run country my way!
<|endoftext|>
My campaign for president is $35,000,000 under budget, I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C.

Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008. He was terrible, failed badly, and was called a racist!
<|endoftext|>
Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double &amp, triple them, a disaster!
<|endoftext|>
Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few,  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!
<|endoftext|>
Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. We now are part time, sad! I WILL FIX!
<|endoftext|>
The middle-class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD
<|endoftext|>
If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong!
<|endoftext|>
Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST!
<|endoftext|>
Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid!  RNC
<|endoftext|>
The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!
<|endoftext|>
R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!
<|endoftext|>
It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!
<|endoftext|>
I will do far more for women than Hillary, and I will keep our country safe, something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate!
<|endoftext|>
A new terror warning was issued for European cties. At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. Weak leaders!
<|endoftext|>
Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!
<|endoftext|>
The Phoenix V.A., it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous, and people are dying. I will fix it
<|endoftext|>
The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary.
<|endoftext|>
"When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say ""we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it?"" Never!"
<|endoftext|>
Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop, I will fix this quickly!
<|endoftext|>
We have many problems in our house (country!), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!
<|endoftext|>
Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!
<|endoftext|>
I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!
<|endoftext|>
Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly
<|endoftext|>
"Hillary said ""I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign."" I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity"
<|endoftext|>
"Hillary, when you complain about ""a penchant for sexism,"" who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!"
<|endoftext|>
The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.
<|endoftext|>
We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!
<|endoftext|>
It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!
<|endoftext|>
When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!
<|endoftext|>
"For those on TV defending my use of the word ""schlonged,"" bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM"
<|endoftext|>
"Once again, #MSM is dishonest. ""Schlonged"" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got ""schlonged"" that meant beaten badly."
<|endoftext|>
Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!

Getting ready to leave for Michigan - will be an amazing evening! See you there.
<|endoftext|>
"Do you think that Hillary Clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about ""the video"" of me being used by ISIS. There is no video."
<|endoftext|>
A suicide bomber has just killed U.S. troops in Afghanistan. When will our leaders get tough and smart. We are being led to slaughter!
<|endoftext|>
It's the Democrats' total weakness &amp, incompetence that gave rise to ISIS --  not a tape of Donald Trump that was an admitted Hillary lie!
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Just out: TRUMP GOP DEBATE - 18,000,000. CLINTON DEMOCRAT DEBATE - 6,700,000. And they were on major network vs. cable!
<|endoftext|>
"Hillary said with respect to ISIS, ""we are finally where we need to be."" Do we want 4  more years of incompetent leadership?  MAGA!"
<|endoftext|>
I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate. There never was a video.
<|endoftext|>
"Hillary said at debate ISIS is ""going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst."" She made up story-want apology!"
<|endoftext|>
Very sad what happened last night at the Miss Universe Pageant. I sold it 6 months ago for a record price. This would never have happened!
<|endoftext|>
It was really strange when Hillary was missing from the podium last night. Not very presidential!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me. Therefore, Hillary LIED at the debate last night. SAD!
<|endoftext|>
President Obama spends so much time speaking of the so-called Carbon footprint, and yet he flies all the way to Hawaii on a massive old 747.
<|endoftext|>
See, Sanders backed Hillary on E-mails at the debate, hurting himself, and then she threw him under the bus (but failed). Disloyal person!
<|endoftext|>
The last thing our country needs is another BUSH! Dumb as a rock!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton is weak and ineffective - no strength, no stamina.
<|endoftext|>
Jeb Bush had a tough night at the debate. Now he'll probably take some of his special interest money, he is their puppet, and buy ad's.
<|endoftext|>
Bill O'Reilly calls Trump and  campaign brilliant. In first place by 27 points.
<|endoftext|>
Thank you, so many people have given me credit for winning the debate last night. All polls agree. It was fun and interesting!

Highly respected PUBLIC POLICY POLLING (PPP) just announced that I am number one in IOWA. Thank you!

New CNN Iowa poll --- Trump 33, Cruz 20. Everyone else way down! Don't trust Des Moines Register poll- biased towards Trump!
<|endoftext|>
Just got back from Iowa, great people!
<|endoftext|>
Tom Ridge should be focused on trying to bring the party together rather than ripping it apart w/ your faulty thought process. I will win!
<|endoftext|>
Never get good #'s from failing Des Moines Register/Bloomberg. I think something's going on w/them. Up 13 in IA according to respected CNN.
<|endoftext|>
Great evening last night in  New Hampshire. Got the endorsement from the New England Police Union - big  territory, great people! Thank you.
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Our VISA system is broken, like so much else in our country. We better get it fixed really fast. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, my poll numbers have just been announced and have gone through the roof!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton does not have the STRENGTH or STAMINA to be President. We need strong and super smart for our next leader - or trouble!
<|endoftext|>
The last person corrupt Hillary Clinton wants to run against is Donald J. Trump. I'll end up beating her in every state. New Fox Poll-Trump!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, what a day. So many foolish people that refuse to acknowledge the tremendous  danger and uncertainty of certain people coming into U.S.
<|endoftext|>
Our country is facing a major threat from radical Islamic terrorism. We better get very smart, and very tough, FAST, before it is too late!
<|endoftext|>
Prior to the end of the year, I will be traveling to Israel. I am very much looking forward to it.
<|endoftext|>
A very big poll is coming out at 6 PM in New Hampshire. Will be very interested in the results.
<|endoftext|>
The main stream media wants to surrender constitutional rights -- I believe #ISIS needs to surrender!
<|endoftext|>
Just put out a very important policy statement on the extraordinary influx of hatred &amp, danger coming into our country. We must be vigilant!
<|endoftext|>
I am especially grateful for the tremendous support I have received from the Evangelicals in the just out Iowa CNN poll. Thank you!
<|endoftext|>
I am greatly honored by the results of the CNN poll in Iowa. In the end, I believe the final results will be even better than that!
<|endoftext|>
N.Y.C. has the worst Mayor in the United States. I hate watching what is happening with the dirty streets, the homeless and crime! Disgrace

"I spoke with other candidates to a Jewish group, many friends, in D.C. I said ""I'm a negotiator like you"" Got standing O-rated best of day!"
<|endoftext|>
Obama said in his speech that Muslims are our sports heroes. What sport is he talking about, and who? Is Obama profiling?
<|endoftext|>
Well, Obama refused to say (he just can't say it), that we are at WAR with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.
<|endoftext|>
Should have gone after the oil years ago (like I have been saying).
<|endoftext|>
Wish Obama would say ISIS, like almost everyone else, rather than ISIL.
<|endoftext|>
Hope he won't spend too much time ripping apart the 2nd. Amendment!
<|endoftext|>
The podium in the Oval Office looks odd! Not good, but the words will be the key.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary won't call out radical Islam! She will be soundly defeated.
<|endoftext|>
I will be re-tweeting some of your better, most imaginative and hopefully insightful tweets. Make them good (great)! Important stuff.
<|endoftext|>
BIG NIGHT ON TWITTER TONIGHT. I WILL BE LIVE TWEETING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH AT 7:50 P.M. ( EASTERN). MUST TALK RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM!

I will be live-tweeting President Obama's prime-time speech tonight starting at 7:50 P.M. (Eastern).Will he finally state the real problems?
<|endoftext|>
So, how did I do on Face The Nation?
<|endoftext|>
Watch Face The Nation - will be on now!
<|endoftext|>
"Hillary just said that she will not use the term ""radical Islamic"" - but was incapable of saying why. She is afraid of  Obama &amp, the e-mails!"
<|endoftext|>
Wonder if Obama will ever say RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST?
<|endoftext|>
Raleigh, North Carolina, was fantastic last night. Such incredible spirit. We all want to, and will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
The horrible shooting that took place in San Bernardino was an absolute act of terror that many people knew about. Why didn’t they report?
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Heading to Manassas, Virginia, for a rally. Will have a moment of silence for the victims of the California shootings. So sad!
<|endoftext|>
#TeamTrump. Police and law enforcement seem to have killed one of the California shooters and are in a shootout with the others. Go police
<|endoftext|>
California shooting looks very bad. Good luck to law enforcement and God bless. This is when our police are so appreciated!
<|endoftext|>
Just arrived in New Hampshire. Another packed venue! Will be fun.
<|endoftext|>
You would think a paper like the Washington Post would be fair and objective. For the record, almost all polls showed I won all debates.
<|endoftext|>
Highly untalented Wash Post blogger, Jennifer Rubin, a real dummy, never writes fairly about me. Why does Wash Post have low IQ people?
<|endoftext|>
I want to thank all my friends in Macon for the special evening and great reception. What a crowd of incredible people!
<|endoftext|>
Meeting with African American Pastors at Trump Tower was amazing. Wonderful news conference followed. Now off to Georgia for big speech!
<|endoftext|>
The Republican establishment, out of self preservation, is concerned w/ my high poll #'s. More concerned are Dems—I beat Hillary heads up!
<|endoftext|>
How is Chris Christie running the state of NJ, which is deeply troubled, when he is spending all of his time in NH? New Jerseyans not happy!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, the MSM is really going after me. 12,000 in Sarasota, a love fest, hardly a mention. Only one negativity - they only want negatives!
<|endoftext|>
After my meeting with the pastors, it's off to Georgia for a big rally - many thousands of great people will be there, a beautiful movement!
<|endoftext|>
Will be meeting on Monday at Trump Tower with a large group of African American Pastors. Many I know-wonderful people! Not a press event.
<|endoftext|>
The Sarasota, Florida, rally today was amazing. 12,000 people chanting their love for our country. It's going to happen, this is a MOVEMENT!
<|endoftext|>
Virtually no-one has spent more money in helping the  American people with disabilities than me. Will discuss today at my speech in Sarasota
<|endoftext|>
The reporter who pulled-back from his 14 year old never retracted story is having fun. I don't know what he looks like and don't know him!
<|endoftext|>
I will be going to Sarasota, Florida, today for a big rally with amazing people! I have one goal on mind: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Happy Thanksgiving to all. Have a great day and look forward to the future. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Going to Ohio, home of one of the worst presidential candidates in history--Kasich. Can't debate, loves #ObamaCare--dummy!
<|endoftext|>
Going to Columbus, Ohio today for a tremendous rally of thousands. The silent majority is no longer silent!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton is weak on illegal immigration, among many other things. She is strong on corruption - corruption is what she's best at!
<|endoftext|>
We better get tough with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS, and get tough now, or the life and safety of our wonderful country will be in jeopardy!
<|endoftext|>
13 Syrian refugees were caught trying to get into the U.S. through the Southern Border. How many made it?  WE NEED THE WALL!

Thank you John Nolte for wonderful analysis &amp, reporting.

I didn't suggest a database-a reporter did. We must defeat Islamic terrorism &amp, have surveillance, including a watch list, to protect America
<|endoftext|>
Going to South Carolina now, great place, SRO crowd. Iowa was amazing yesterday!
<|endoftext|>
The media must denigrate ISIS at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it. These are low level degenerates, NOT masterminds!
<|endoftext|>
"The media must immediately stop calling ISIS leaders ""MASTERMINDS."" Call them instead thugs and losers. Young people must not go into ISIS!"
<|endoftext|>
A wonderful afternoon in Iowa! Great people! Heading now to Florida - tomorrow, South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
<|endoftext|>
John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed, bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure!
<|endoftext|>
Once John Kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete &amp, total dud!
<|endoftext|>
John Kasich fell right into President Obama’s trap on ObamaCare, and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!
<|endoftext|>
Doesn’t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else  - he’s almost last.
<|endoftext|>
I loved beating John Kasich in the debates, but it was easy—he came in dead last!
<|endoftext|>
Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart!
<|endoftext|>
Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!
<|endoftext|>
I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money.
<|endoftext|>
John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!
<|endoftext|>
John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me.
<|endoftext|>
Governor Kasich, whose failed campaign &amp, debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me.
<|endoftext|>
The legendary Barbara Walters interviews Melania Trump and me on a special this Friday night at 10:00 on ABC. Don't miss it!
<|endoftext|>
The POLICE in Paris did a fantastic job. Very brave - not easy!
<|endoftext|>
Everyone is now saying how right I was with illegal immigration &amp, the wall. After Paris, they’re all on the bandwagon.
<|endoftext|>
Eight Syrians were just caught on the southern border trying to get into the U.S. ISIS maybe? I told you so. WE NEED A BIG &amp, BEAUTIFUL WALL!
<|endoftext|>
Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country. Who knows who they are - some could be ISIS. Is our president insane?
<|endoftext|>
I, along with almost everyone else, have so little confidence in President Obama. He has a horrible attitude-a man who is resigned to defeat
<|endoftext|>
So many great polls like Reuters - big leads everywhere. New Hampshire really special! We will win big and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Just landing in Knoxville, Tennessee! Massive crowd expected! Will all have a great time, despite serious subject matter.
<|endoftext|>
Will be landing in Knoxville, Tennessee shortly - tremendous crowd expected. It's all very simple, we want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
<|endoftext|>
Remember, I was the one who said attack the oil (ISIS source of wealth) a long time ago. Everyone scoffed, now they're attacking the oil.
<|endoftext|>
Tom Brady just did it again. He is not only a great guy, he is, without question, the BEST quarterback!
<|endoftext|>
President Obama just told President Putin how important the Russian air strikes against ISIS have been. I TOLD YOU SO!
<|endoftext|>
We need strong, tough and brilliant leadership now more than ever!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
I had a great time in Texas yesterday. A tremendous crowd of wonderful and enthusiastic people. Will be back soon!
<|endoftext|>
When will President Obama issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM? He  can't say it, and unless he will,  the problem will not be solved!
<|endoftext|>
I think everyone will like my new and very successful book, Crippled America. Go get it and let me know what you think!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, Bernie Sanders just admitted that the real unemployment rate is 10% (it is actually over 20%) and for  African American youth - 51%.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary and Sanders are not doing well, but what is the failed former Mayor of Baltimore doing on that stage? O'Malley is a clown.
<|endoftext|>
Why won't President Obama use the term Islamic Terrorism? Isn't it now, after all of this time and so much death, about time!
<|endoftext|>
We need much tougher, much smarter leadership - and we need it NOW!
<|endoftext|>
"President Obama said ""ISIL continues to shrink"" in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in Paris. He is just so bad! CHANGE."
<|endoftext|>
My prayers are with the victims and hostages in the horrible Paris attacks. May God be with you all.
<|endoftext|>
They laughed at me when I said to bomb the ISIS controlled oil fields. Now they are not laughing and doing what I said. #Trump2016
<|endoftext|>
Thank you Arkansas! #Trump2016#SuperTuesday
<|endoftext|>
First candidate in Virginia with over 16,000 validated signatures for the ballot. An honor - thank you! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
<|endoftext|>
From 2% to 27% in Texas - quite a jump into first place!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, pres. candidate Ben Carson, who is very weak on illegal Immigration, just said  he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship.
<|endoftext|>
We, as a country, either have borders or we don't. IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!
<|endoftext|>
Just returned home from the great state of New Hampshire. Have made so many friends there--special place!
<|endoftext|>
Happy Veterans Day. To those who have served, thank you for your special work.
<|endoftext|>
Loved doing the debate...won Drudge and all on-line polls! Amazing evening, moderators did an outstanding job.
<|endoftext|>
Go out and buy CRIPPLED AMERICA: How to Make America Great Again. Doing really well. Great Thanksgiving or Christmas present!
<|endoftext|>
Marco Rubio is totally weak on illegal immigration &amp, in favor of easy amnesty. A lightweight choker - bad for #USA!
<|endoftext|>
Marco Rubio couldn't even respond properly to President Obama's State of the Union Speech without pouring sweat &amp, chugging water. He choked!
<|endoftext|>
Marco Rubio is a total lightweight who I wouldn’t hire to run one of my smaller companies - a highly overrated politician!
<|endoftext|>
Amazing evening at Saturday Night Live!
<|endoftext|>
"I am at the Saturday Night Live Studio - electricity all over the place. We will be doing a ""tweeting"" skit, so stay tuned!"
<|endoftext|>
They are saying that tickets to tonight's Saturday Night Live are the hardest to get in the history of this great show! Off to a good start!
<|endoftext|>
Saturday Night Live has some incredible things in store tonight. The great thing about playing myself is that it will be authentic! Enjoy
<|endoftext|>
So sad that Obama rejected Keystone Pipeline. Thousands of jobs, good for the environment, no downside!
<|endoftext|>
"Carson now admits his friend named ""Bob,"" who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle!), no longer exists as Bob. Wrong name!"
<|endoftext|>
With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?
<|endoftext|>
Florida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio. So do two people who worked with him. Said he used the wrong credit card! Sure.
<|endoftext|>
Whether you think you can or think you can't---you are right. -- Henry Ford
<|endoftext|>
The Carson story is either a total fabrication or, if true, even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend!
<|endoftext|>
"Jeb Bush just said about Marco Rubio, ""he's my friend!"" Pure political speak. Why can't he be truthful and say ""disloyal guy, no friend!"""
<|endoftext|>
Just landed in New Hampshire - a very exciting morning planned!
<|endoftext|>
Join me today, Nov 3rd, in #TrumpTowerNYC at noon. I'll be signing copies of my new book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don't miss it!
<|endoftext|>
Join me tomorrow, Nov. 3rd, at 12pm in #TrumpTowerNY. I’ll be signing copies of my new book CRIPPLED AMERICA.  Don’t miss it!
<|endoftext|>
Now that Iran ripped us off by making one of the best deals of any kind in history, they have just moved to block any imports from the U.S.
<|endoftext|>
While in politics it is often smart to send out false messages, one thing is clear:  That Hillary does not want to run against TRUMP.
<|endoftext|>
Join me Tuesday Nov. 3rd at 12 PM in #TrumpTower in NYC. I'll be signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don't miss it!
<|endoftext|>
If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered!
<|endoftext|>
"Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a ""lightweight""."
<|endoftext|>
I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!
<|endoftext|>
"Jeb's new slogan - ""Jeb can fix it"". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word ""fix"" is not a good one to use in politics!"
<|endoftext|>
Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win
<|endoftext|>
Gov. John Kasich has really failed on the campaign trail. I thought he would have been far more talented. He is just wasting time &amp, money!
<|endoftext|>
No complaints but how many people would be watching these really dumb but record setting debates if I wasn't in them? Interesting question!
<|endoftext|>
Support Coach Kennedy and his right, together with his young players, to pray on the football field. Liberty Institute just suspended him!
<|endoftext|>
Lifting off right now for U.S.S. Wisconsin in Norfolk. See ya'
<|endoftext|>
I am leaving for Norfolk, Virginia - the great battleship U.S.S. Wisconsin - for a big rally and really big crowd. See you soon!
<|endoftext|>
"I see Marco Rubio just landed another billionaire to give big money to his Superpac, which are total scams. Marco must address him as ""SIR""!"
<|endoftext|>
The new NBC POLL has me in first place but said I was third in the debate - I demand a recount (just kidding!). EVERY other poll had me #1.
<|endoftext|>
Black Lives Matter protesters totally disrupt Hillary Clinton event. She looked lost. This is not what we need with ISIS, CHINA, RUSSIA etc.
<|endoftext|>
I am going to save Medicare and Medicaid, Carson wants to abolish, and failing candidate Gov. John Kasich doesn't have a clue - weak!
<|endoftext|>
Super PACs should be disavowed by anyone running for President. They are a total scam on our system and country! I am self-funding.
<|endoftext|>
Join me Tuesday, Nov. 3rd at 12pm in Trump Tower NYC.  I’ll be signing copies of my new book CRIPPLED AMERICA.  Don’t miss it!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to everybody for your wonderful comments on my debate performance - it was a lot of fun! Today I will be speaking in Reno, Nevada.
<|endoftext|>
After a great evening and packed auditorium in Iowa, I am now in Colorado looking forward to what I am sure will be a very unfair debate!
<|endoftext|>
I am leaving for Sioux City, Iowa - great event (rally).
<|endoftext|>
New Gravis national poll just out --- 36%! Very nice! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
<|endoftext|>
All Presidential candidates should immediately disavow their Super PAC’s. They're not only breaking the spirit of the law but the law itself
<|endoftext|>
Re Super PAC scam:  What the other candidates are doing is a disgrace.
<|endoftext|>
This whole Super PAC scam is very unfair to a person like me who has disavowed all PAC's &amp, is self-funding.
<|endoftext|>
Thank you Virginia! #Trump2016#SuperTuesday
<|endoftext|>
Ben Carson wants to abolish Medicare - I want to save it and Social Security.
<|endoftext|>
Remember that Carson, Bush and Rubio are VERY weak on illegal immigration. They will do NOTHING to stop it. Our country will be overrun!
<|endoftext|>
Do you think I will get credit for keeping Ford in U.S. Who cares, my supporters know the truth. Think what can be done as president!
<|endoftext|>
Word is that Ford Motor, because of my constant badgering at packed events, is going to cancel their deal to go to Mexico and stay in U.S.
<|endoftext|>
Ben Carson has never created a job in his life (well, maybe a nurse). I have created tens of thousands of jobs, it's what I do.
<|endoftext|>
This is just not the right time for Jeb Bush. His campaign is in total disarray, too much staff being paid way too much money = U.S. GOVT.
<|endoftext|>
While Jeb Bush is cutting staff and salaries, after having paid ridiculous amounts of money, why did he pay so much in the first place?
<|endoftext|>
Expecting a great crowd of amazing people. Questions will be live! #TrumpToday
<|endoftext|>
Just finished speaking in Jacksonville, Florida. Incredible crowd, fantastic people. Thank you!
<|endoftext|>
Leaving for Jacksonville now. See you there! Miami was great.
<|endoftext|>
Massive crowds already forming in Jacksonville - will be and incredible day - 12 noon!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Crowd was amazing tonight at Trump National Doral in Miami. Love and excitement in the ballroom. Tomorrow at noon in Jacksonville!
<|endoftext|>
The young intern who accidentally did a Retweet apologizes.
<|endoftext|>
I think Joe Biden made correct decision for him &amp, his family. Personally, I would rather run against Hillary because her record is so bad.
<|endoftext|>
New poll by ABC News/Washington Post  TRUMP 32  CARSON 22  RUBIO 10  BUSH 7  Wow, how will the media put a negative spin on this one?
<|endoftext|>
Just out: Boston Herald/Franklin Pierce Poll  N.H.  TRUMP 28 (up 10)  CARSON 16  BUSH 9  RUBIO 6  CRUZ 5  Press will say they are surging!
<|endoftext|>
Both Aberdeen and Turnberry in Scotland, and the soon to open Doonbeg in Ireland, blow Bandon Dunes away. Bandon is a toy by comparison!
<|endoftext|>
Jeb is fighting to defend a catastrophic event. I am fighting to make sure it doesn't happen again.Jeb is too soft-we need tougher &amp, sharper
<|endoftext|>
It's really cold outside, they are calling it a major freeze, weeks ahead of normal. Man, we could use a big fat dose of global warming!
<|endoftext|>
"Just reported by CNN that ""the Trump halo effect""  caused a record-shattering Democratic Debate rating of 15.3 million viewers. So true!"
<|endoftext|>
It's amazing that some of the dumbest people on television work for the Wall Street Journal, in particular a real dope named Charles Lane!
<|endoftext|>
Jeb, why did your brother attack and destabalize the Middle East by attacking Iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction? Bad info?
<|endoftext|>
This morning Chris Wallace has the best political show on television - but that's only because I'm on it (kidding)! Have fun.
<|endoftext|>
Jeb Bush should stop trying to defend his brother and focus on his own shortcomings and how to fix them. Also, Rubio is hitting him hard!
<|endoftext|>
On at 9:00A.M. or 10:00 A.M. (depending on your location)  on Fox is a tough but really good interview with Chris Wallace. Enjoy!
<|endoftext|>
"Will be interviewed on ""Media Buzz"" with Howie Kurtz on Fox, Sunday at 11:00 A.M."
<|endoftext|>
Good news for those that want to Make America Great Again - I am winning every poll in every STATE and NATIONAL - and by big numbers! Thanks
<|endoftext|>
I will be interviewed on Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace at 9:00 A.M. or 10:00 A.M. (depending on location). Will be tough but good!
<|endoftext|>
In Massachusetts --- the place is packed! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
<|endoftext|>
Every poll, Time, Drudge, Slate and others, said I won both debates - but heard Megyn Kelly had her two puppets say bad stuff. I don't watch
<|endoftext|>
Megyn Kelly has two really dumb puppets, Chris Stirewalt &amp, Marc Threaten (a Bushy) who do exactly what she says. All polls say I won debates
<|endoftext|>
Steven Tyler got more publicity on his song request than he’s gotten in ten years. Good for him!
<|endoftext|>
Even though I have the legal right to use Steven Tyler’s song, he asked me not to. Have better one to take its place!
<|endoftext|>
Will be going to Richmond, Virginia today. Big crowd! See you there.
<|endoftext|>
The debate last night proved that Hillary is running against the “B” team. She won’t be so lucky when it comes to me!
<|endoftext|>
#DemDebate was really boring but had a lot of fun live tweeting and picked up by far the most followers.
<|endoftext|>
Like her or not, Hillary did what she had to do in the debate last night—get through it. Her opponents were very gentle and soft!
<|endoftext|>
Check out OAN and compare to what you are watching now!
<|endoftext|>
Notice that illegal immigrants will be given ObamaCare and free college tuition but nothing has been mentioned about our VETERANS #DemDebate
<|endoftext|>
Sanders said only black lives matter - wow! Hillary did not answer question!
<|endoftext|>
Sorry, there is no STAR on the stage tonight!
<|endoftext|>
Good move by Bernie S.
<|endoftext|>
The hardest thing Clinton has to do is defend her bad decision making including Iraq vote, e-mails etc.
<|endoftext|>
All are very scripted and rehearsed, two (at least) should not be on the stage.
<|endoftext|>
Who is winning the debate so far (just last name)? #DemDebate
<|endoftext|>
O'Malley, as former Mayor of Baltimore, has very little chance.
<|endoftext|>
Can anyone imagine Chafee as president? No way.
<|endoftext|>
The trade deal is a disaster, she was always for it! #DemDebate
<|endoftext|>
We will all have fun and hopefully learn something tonight. I will shoot straight and call it as I see it, both the good and the bad. Enjoy!
<|endoftext|>
Should be interesting but too bad the three guys at《1% will be taking up so much time -  but who knows, maybe a star will be born (unlikely)
<|endoftext|>
How can Jeb Bush expect to deal with China, Russia + Iran if he gets caught doing a “plant” during my speech yesterday in NH?
<|endoftext|>
The arrogant young woman who questioned me in such a nasty fashion at No Labels yesterday was a Jeb staffer! HOW CAN HE BEAT RUSSIA &amp, CHINA?
<|endoftext|>
Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree!
<|endoftext|>
At the request of many, and even though I expect it to be a very boring two hours, I will be covering the Democrat Debate live on twitter!
<|endoftext|>
Heading for Atlanta tomorrow morning for noon speech at North Atlanta Trade Center. Big crowds, great people!
<|endoftext|>
Leaving soon after a great time in New Hampshire, a truly special place!
<|endoftext|>
I will be on Face The Nation (CBS) today at 10:30 A.M. and Media Buzz (Fox News) at 11:00 A.M. Enjoy!
<|endoftext|>
Just got back from Georgia. The crowds and love for U.S. was so amazing! We all had a great day together - will be back soon!
<|endoftext|>
Little Barry Diller, who lost a fortune on Newsweek and Daily Beast, only writes badly about me. He is a sad and pathetic figure. Lives lie!
<|endoftext|>
I'm leading big in every poll and we are going to WIN! Remember, Trump NEVER gives up!
<|endoftext|>
Paul Ryan is far from my first choice, but a very nice guy. The Republicans should go for tough and (very) smart this time - no games!
<|endoftext|>
Washington (D.C.) is such a mess - nothing works! I will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  It's not going to happen with anyone else.
<|endoftext|>
Great, Kevin McCarthy drops out of SPEAKER race. We need a really smart and really tough person to take over this very  important job!
<|endoftext|>
I'm at Trump Int'l Hotel in Las Vegas, tallest/most beautiful building in town. Speaking to another great crowd at Treasure Island (12 noon)
<|endoftext|>
What a time we all had in Iowa yesterday, massive overflow crowd. Love them!
<|endoftext|>
Just arrived in Las Vegas for a packed house speech tomorrow. Big poll results today, Leading big everywhere. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Iowa was amazing today. Great crowd, great people. Thanks, will be back soon!
<|endoftext|>
Just found out I won the Rockingham County Republican Booth Straw Poll at the Deerfield Fair in New Hampshire this past weekend. 39% ---Wow!
<|endoftext|>
Heading to a packed house in Waterloo, Iowa! Will celebrate today's great poll numbers together. See you soon!
<|endoftext|>
If Stuart Stevens' book is as bad as his horrible political advice to Mitt Romney, don't waste your money. Arrogant guy but a zero!
<|endoftext|>
Ben Carson was speaking in general terms as to what he would do if confronted with a gunman, and was not criticizing the victims. Not fair!
<|endoftext|>
Don't ever forget, we will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
So, so, so important - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Political strategist Stuart Stevens,who led Romney down the tubes in what should have been an easy victory,has terrible political instincts!
<|endoftext|>
Thoughts and prayers for those in the floods affecting the great people of South Carolina.
<|endoftext|>
The incompetence of our current administration is beyond comprehension. TPP is a terrible deal.
<|endoftext|>
For all of my fantastic  supporters, and for the U.S.A., we are going to win and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, maybe greater than ever before!
<|endoftext|>
I'm leading by big margins in every poll but the press keeps asking, would you ever get out? They are just troublemakers, I'm going to win!
<|endoftext|>
The people of Tennessee yesterday were amazing. Thank you!
<|endoftext|>
"Rubio was very disloyal to Bush, his mentor, when he decided to run against him. Both said they ""love"" each other.They don't - word is hate!"
<|endoftext|>
"Bush and Rubio are finally attacking each other, as I knew they would, in order to be the last ""establishment"" man standing against me.Great"
<|endoftext|>
Will be in Nashville, Tennessee, tomorrow (Saturday) at 2:30 P.M. So much to talk about - see you there!
<|endoftext|>
I was so looking forward to being in Virginia Beach, Virginia, today. The demand for tickets was amazing. Good luck with storm, back soon!
<|endoftext|>
My warmest condolences to the families of the horrible Roseburg, Oregon, shootings.
<|endoftext|>
Just got back from New Hampshire. Great crowd, great people! Will be back soon!
<|endoftext|>
Rubio is totally owned by the lobbyists and special interests. A lightweight senator with the worst voting record in Senate. Lazy!
<|endoftext|>
"Just read that ""Trump"" has the largest (and I add most enthusiastic) crowds. Tonight I will be in New Hampshire - the place will be packed!"
<|endoftext|>
I watched lightweight Senator  Marco Rubio, who is all talk and no action, defend his WEAK position on illegal immigration. Pathetic!
<|endoftext|>
"Carl Icahn said this about me:  ""I think at this moment in time, he’s the only candidate that speaks out about the country’s problems."""
<|endoftext|>
I hope when Rand Paul gets out of the race—he is at 1%--his supporters come over to me. I will do a much better job for them.
<|endoftext|>
Prediction: Rand Paul has been driven out of the race by my statements about him-- he will announce soon. 1%!
<|endoftext|>
Do you believe this - Iran wants to trade our 3 prisoners (not 4) for 19 prisoners held by the U.S. Should have been let go with last deal!
<|endoftext|>
Marco Rubio is a member of the Gang Of Eight or, very weak on stopping illegal immigration. Only changed when poll numbers crashed.
<|endoftext|>
Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is VERY weak on immigration, knows nothing about finance and would be incapable of making great trade deals!
<|endoftext|>
Just left Oklahoma--- the most amazing crowd and people! What a night!
<|endoftext|>
I am now inspecting the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue - will be a great hotel. Soon off to the Oklahoma State Fair!
<|endoftext|>
.....Ahead of schedule and under budget! Will be in Oklahoma tonight!
<|endoftext|>
Great reception in D.C. At the Values Voter Summit. Now checking on my job at the Old Post Office...
<|endoftext|>
Despite the establishment and the media’s best efforts, the people are speaking loudly and clearly. Thank you to my amazing supporters!
<|endoftext|>
"Headline reads"" Rubio passes Bush in Florida poll"" -- Unfair, because Trump destroys them both! Trump 31.5%, Rubio 19.2%, Bush 11.3%"
<|endoftext|>
Just remember, the birther movement was started by Hillary Clinton in 2008. She was all in!
<|endoftext|>
We are going to WIN and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, maybe better than ever before!
<|endoftext|>
"Senator Marco ""amnesty"" Rubio, who has worst voting record in Senate, just hit me on national security-but I said don't go into Iraq. VISION"

2016 Republican Primary Morning Consult Poll was just released. TRUMP 32, CARSON 12, BUSH 11, FIORINA 6, RUBIO 5, CRUZ 5. Taken after debate
<|endoftext|>
Leaving for Mobile, Alabama, right now - can't be late!
<|endoftext|>
Carly Fiorina did such a horrible job at Lucent and HP, virtually destroying both companies, that she never got another CEO job offer! Pres.
<|endoftext|>
I am attracting the biggest crowds, by far, and the best poll numbers, also by far.   Much of the media is totally dishonest. So sad!
<|endoftext|>
There is no way that Carly  Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems. Boxer killed her for Senate in California!
<|endoftext|>
On my way to Iowa. Will be landing in Des Moines in two hours. See ya!
<|endoftext|>
Christians need support in our country (and around the world), their religious liberty is at stake! Obama has been horrible, I will be great
<|endoftext|>
If I would have challenged the man, the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech. A no win situation!
<|endoftext|>
If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president, do you really think he would come to my rescue? No chance!
<|endoftext|>
This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something.
<|endoftext|>
Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I don't think so!
<|endoftext|>
GIVE AMERICA BACK ITS DREAM!    -- Donald J. Trump
<|endoftext|>
Going to New Hampshire in a little while. Big crowds! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
<|endoftext|>
Every poll done on debate last night, from Drudge to Newsmax to Time Magazine, had me winning in a landslide. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to Tom Brady, Coach Ditka, Coach Bobby Knight and all of the many champions that have been so supportive!
<|endoftext|>
I hope Arnold S. does well with the Apprentice because he is a nice guy and also, because I get a big percentage of the profits!
<|endoftext|>
Just finished the wonderful event on the U.S.S. Iowa. VETERANS FOR A STRONG AMERICA endorsed me. Such a great honor, thank you!
<|endoftext|>
The polls are really looking good—#1 everywhere despite all lobbyist &amp, special interest $ being spent against me. I’m turning down millions.
<|endoftext|>
"Little respected Club For Growth asked me for $1,000,000 - I said ""NO"". Now they are spending lobbyist and special interest money on ads!"
<|endoftext|>
Am now in L.A. Will be going to the U.S.S. IOWA at 5:30 P.M. to speak to our great VETERANS and other friends!
<|endoftext|>
Loved Dallas and the tremendous crowd last night. Will be back!
<|endoftext|>
Speech in Dallas went really well. Big and wonderful crowd. Just arrived in L.A. Big day tomorrow!
<|endoftext|>
My opponents big bosses--lobbyists and donors--are trying to do damage. They will fail! Money down the drain!
<|endoftext|>
To all my fans, sorry I couldn’t do The Apprentice any longer—but equal time (presidential run) prohibits me from doing so. Love!
<|endoftext|>
Why is someone like George Pataki, who did a terrible job as Governor of N.Y. and registers ZERO in the polls, allowed on the debate stage?
<|endoftext|>
I am having a great time in Iowa at Jack Trice Stadium! Unbelievable people.
<|endoftext|>
Just purchased NBC’s half of The Miss Universe Organization and settled all lawsuits against them. Now own 100% -- stay tuned!
<|endoftext|>
Let’s all take a moment to remember all of the heroes from a very tragic day that we cannot let happen again!
<|endoftext|>
Also, tomorrow night I will be going to Boone and Ames. Really look forward to seeing all of my friends in Iowa.
<|endoftext|>
Very good news—the new Quinnipiac poll just came out—I am #1 in Iowa.
<|endoftext|>
.... I only respond to people that register more than 1% in the polls. I never thought he had a chance and I’ve been proven right.
<|endoftext|>
Bobby Jindal did not make the debate stage and therefore I have never met him....
<|endoftext|>
Wow, I am ahead of the field with Evangelicals (am so proud of this) and virtually every other group, and Ben Carson just took a swipe at me
<|endoftext|>
I had a great day in D.C. even though the subject was an unpleasant one, the horrible Iran Nuke deal. Amazing crowd and enthusiasm!
<|endoftext|>
See you in D.C. tomorrow at 1:00 P.M. at the Capitol to protest the horribly negotiated deal with Iran. Really sad!
<|endoftext|>
Jeb’s policies in Florida helped lead to its almost total collapse. Right after he left he went to work for Lehman Brothers—wow!
<|endoftext|>
"The lobbyists &amp, special interests have just put out an ad for Jeb which hits me ""just a little"" but is very false!"
<|endoftext|>
I’m self funding my campaign but lobbyists &amp, special interests for Jeb &amp, others are starting to do big ads—desperate! Don’t believe them.
<|endoftext|>
Tomorrow in DC: 1 PM West Front Lawn of the Capitol. Not even believable that we would do this deal with Iran.
<|endoftext|>
Look forward to being in DC tomorrow—big crowd expected for our protest against the truly stupid nuclear deal we are making with Iran.
<|endoftext|>
Both Washington D.C. and DALLAS are turning out to be really big events. D.C. is protest of incompetent Iran deal and Dallas is big speech!
<|endoftext|>
Remember, I'll see you in D.C. at the Capitol Building on Wednesday at 1:00 o'clock. Then Dallas on Sept.14 at 6:00 P.M. American Air Center
<|endoftext|>
I will be in Washington D.C. on Wednesday,1 P.M.,in front of the Capitol, to protest the horrible and incompetent deal being made with Iran.
<|endoftext|>
The Dallas event on September 14 at 6:00 P.M. at the American Airlines Center looks like it will be a giant success. Tickets are going FAST!
<|endoftext|>
Our country needs a president with great leadership skills and vision, not someone like Hillary or Barack, neither of which has a clue!
<|endoftext|>
The phony Club For Growth, which asked me in writing for $1,000,000 (I said no), is now wanting to do negative ads on me. Total hypocrites!
<|endoftext|>
The hedge fund guys (gals) have to pay higher taxes ASAP. They are paying practically nothing. We must reduce taxes for the middle class!
<|endoftext|>
By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists. I am only working for the people of the U.S.!
<|endoftext|>
Remember that I am self-funding my campaign. Hillary, Jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money.100% CONTROLLED
<|endoftext|>
Hillary said such nasty things about me, read directly off her teleprompter...but there was no emotion, no truth. Just can't read speeches!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter I have ever seen. In fact, it wasn't even see through glass, it was black
<|endoftext|>
"Saudi Arabia was ""vehemently"" against the Iran nuclear deal. Then today they embraced it. What happened? What did we give them to endorse?"
<|endoftext|>
"Very low ratings radio host Hugh Hewitt asked me about Suleiman, Abu Bake al-Baghdad, Hassan Nasrallah and more - typical ""gotcha"" questions"
<|endoftext|>
The Dallas event in two weeks, at the American Airlines Center, is filling up fast. Get your tickets fast,  before it is too late!
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations to Tom Brady on yet another great victory- Tom is my friend and a total winner!
<|endoftext|>
The deal with Iran will go down as one of the most incompetent ever made. The U.S. lost on virtually every point. We just don't win anymore!
<|endoftext|>
When I intelligently turned down The Club For Growth crazy request for $1,000,000, they got nasty.What a waste of money that would have been
<|endoftext|>
The president of the pathetic Club For Growth came to my office in N.Y.C. and asked for a ridiculous $1,000,000 contribution. I said no way!
<|endoftext|>
I’m turning down millions of dollars of campaign contributions—feel totally stupid doing so, but hope it is appreciated by the voters.
<|endoftext|>
Many Super Pacs, funded by groups that want total control over their candidate, are being formed to “attack” Trump. Remember when u see them
<|endoftext|>
Congrats everyone--we topped 4 million today on Twitter--and heading up fast!
<|endoftext|>
While millions are being spent against me in attack ads, they are paid for by the “bosses” and “owners” of candidates. I am self funding.
<|endoftext|>
Jeb is spending millions of dollars on “hit” ads funded by lobbyists &amp, special interests. Bad system.
<|endoftext|>
Yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign. Will Jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me?
<|endoftext|>
The just released Public Policy Polling (PPP - national result) is the best yet. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
150 Clinton E-mails still contain classified information. More sensitive when she was Sec.of State. This is a very big deal.
<|endoftext|>
President Obama wants to change the name of Mt. McKinley to Denali after more than 100 years. Great insult to Ohio. I will change back!
<|endoftext|>
For those that don’t think a wall (fence) works, why don’t they suggest taking down the fence around the White House? Foolish people!
<|endoftext|>
Huma Abedin, the top aide to Hillary Clinton and the wife of perv sleazebag Anthony Wiener, was a major security risk as a collector of info
<|endoftext|>
Leading in the Bloomberg Iowa poll. Also, my favorability numbers went up at a record, almost unheard of, clip. Thank you Iowa!
<|endoftext|>
Loved being with my many friends in Tennessee. The crowd and enthusiasm was fantastic. I won the straw poll big!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, Jeb Bush just lost three of his top fundraisers - they quit!
<|endoftext|>
Leaving now for Tennessee. Big crowd!
<|endoftext|>
Great rally last night in Massachusetts. 2000 people at a house - must be a record! Unbelievable spirit to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
<|endoftext|>
Just got back from Iowa. Fantastic evening with truly fabulous people. Will be back again soon. Thanks!
<|endoftext|>
Heading to Iowa to a packed house. Just released polls, all first place, are amazing. Thank you!
<|endoftext|>
"Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a ""fence."" It's not a fence, Jeb, it's a WALL, and there's a BIG difference!"
<|endoftext|>
Asians are very offended that JEB said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics. A mess!
<|endoftext|>
"In a clumsy move to get out of his ""anchor babies"" dilemma, where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it, he blamed ASIANS"
<|endoftext|>
Jeb Bush never uses his last name on advertising, signage, materials etc. Is he ashamed of the name BUSH? A pretty sad situation. Go Jeb!
<|endoftext|>
Markets are crashing - all caused by poor planning and allowing China and Asia to dictate the agenda. This could get very messy! Vote Trump.
<|endoftext|>
As I have long stated, we are so tied in with China and Asia that their markets are now taking the U.S. market down. Get smart U.S.A.
<|endoftext|>
New Reuters Poll just came out and has me at 32%, highest number yet.The silent majority is back and we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
"The last thing we need is another Bush in the White House. Would be the same old thing (remember ""read my lips, no more taxes""). GREATNESS!"
<|endoftext|>
Jeb Bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body. Jeb just can't get it right!
<|endoftext|>
Jeb Bush is weak on illegal immigration, in favor of common core, bad on women's health issues and thinks the Iraq war was a good thing.
<|endoftext|>
Now that I started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border, most other candidates are finally  speaking up. Just politicians!
<|endoftext|>
It has just been confirmed by  the City of Mobile, Alabama, that there were 30,000 people at last nights event, making it  #1for pol season.
<|endoftext|>
How is Bernie Sanders going to defend our country if he can't even defend his own microphone? Very sad!
<|endoftext|>
Alabama was great last night, amazing people. 30,000 folks  was largest crowd of political season. Nice!
<|endoftext|>
Dow dives more than 500 points - down 9% from high. Be careful!
<|endoftext|>
Boston incident is terrible. We need energy and passion, but we must treat each other with respect. I would never condone violence.
<|endoftext|>
How crazy - 7.5% of all births in U.S. are to illegal immigrants, over 300,000 babies per year. This must stop. Unaffordable and not right!
<|endoftext|>
"Jeb Bush signed memo saying not to use the term ""anchor babies,"" offensive. Now he wants to use it because I use it. Stay true to yourself!"
<|endoftext|>
Alabama will shine tomorrow. It will be a big and glorious day!
<|endoftext|>
We are going to make our country so strong again, so great again. No more ripping off the United States. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Just got back from New Hampshire. Amazing people, we all had a great time together!
<|endoftext|>
I am looking forward to being in New Hampshire tomorrow. The silent majority is taking our country back. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
If I am elected President I will immediately approve the Keystone XL pipeline.  No impact on environment &amp, lots of jobs for U.S.
<|endoftext|>
When foreigners attend our great colleges &amp, want to stay in the U.S., they should not be thrown out of our country.
<|endoftext|>
I want talented people to come into this country—to work hard and to become citizens. Silicon Valley needs engineers, etc.
<|endoftext|>
I really enjoyed being at the Iowa State Fair. The crowds, love and enthusiasm is something I will never forget.
<|endoftext|>
Just got back from the Iowa State Fair. Record crowds, phenomenal people. Thank you IOWA, I will never let you down!
<|endoftext|>
In the plane heading to Iowa State Fair. Will be great fun. Hopefully giving helicopter rides to some of the kids.
<|endoftext|>
Making speech tonight in New Hampshire - leaving now. Fantastic people, fantastic crowd!
<|endoftext|>
The #IranDeal is a catastrophe that must be stopped. Will lead to at least partial world destruction &amp, make Iran a force like never before.
<|endoftext|>
We must stop the crime and killing machine that is illegal immigration. Rampant problems will only get worse. Take back our country!
<|endoftext|>
Truly weird Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky reminds me of a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain. He was terrible at DEBATE!
<|endoftext|>
Again, illegal immigrant is charged with the fatal  bludgeoning of a wonderful and loved 64 year old woman. Get them out and build a WALL!
<|endoftext|>
Wonderful Frank Gifford has just passed away at age 84. He was my friend and a truly great guy! Warmest condolences to family.
<|endoftext|>
I just realized that if you listen to Carly Fiorina for more than ten minutes straight, you develop a massive headache. She has zero chance!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, CNN just said that Donald Trump won the DEBATE, connected best with audience. Also, Time, Drudge, Newsmax, N.Y.Times and more!
<|endoftext|>
"Re Megyn Kelly quote: ""you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever"" (NOSE). Just got on w/thought"
<|endoftext|>
"So many ""politically correct"" fools in our country. We have to all get back to work and stop wasting time and energy on nonsense!"
<|endoftext|>
"I look forward to tonight's ""debate"" -- but look far more forward to making America great again. It can happen!"
<|endoftext|>
Do you notice that Hillary spews out Jeb's name as often as possible in order to give him status? She knows Trump is her worst nightmare.
<|endoftext|>
Many of Hillary’s donors are the same donors as Jeb Bush’s—all rich, will have total control—know them well.
<|endoftext|>
Diligence is the mother of good luck. -- Benjamin Franklin
<|endoftext|>
We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.  --  Albert Einstein
<|endoftext|>
It came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary’s private illegal emails. Huma’s PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world.
<|endoftext|>
I wish good luck to all of the Republican candidates that traveled to California to beg for money etc. from the Koch Brothers. Puppets?
<|endoftext|>
If you think you can do a thing or think you can't do a thing, you're right. -- Henry Ford
<|endoftext|>
Wow, some new and even greater polls--thank you!
<|endoftext|>
The polls have been consistently great. The silent majority is speaking. Politicians are failing. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
<|endoftext|>
I look forward to the debate on Thursday night &amp, it is certainly my intention to be very nice &amp, highly respectful of the other candidates.
<|endoftext|>
Just at a news conference from Trump Turnberry in Scotland. Everybody was there &amp, will be all over television tonite. Back on trail Saturday
<|endoftext|>
Getting ready to leave for my GREAT resort, Turnberry, in Scotland. Hosting The Women's British Open (biggest tournament). Will be back Sat.
<|endoftext|>
I really like the Koch Brothers (members of my P.B. Club), but I don't want their money or anything else from them. Cannot influence Trump!
<|endoftext|>
People like lawyer Elizabeth Beck and failed writer Harry Hurt &amp, others talk about me but know nothing about me—crazy!
<|endoftext|>
How can a dummy dope like Harry Hurt, who wrote a failed book about me but doesn’t know me or anything about me, be on TV discussing Trump?
<|endoftext|>
Trump Will Make America GREAT!!!!  #ChangeTheWorldIn5Words
<|endoftext|>
... while Tom Brady is guilty because he REPLACED his LEGAL cellphone?
<|endoftext|>
I truly LOVE all of the millions of people who are sticking with me despite so many media lies. There is a great SILENT MAJORITY looming!
<|endoftext|>
So many people who know nothing about me are commenting all over T.V. and the media as though they have great D.J.T. insight. Know NOTHING!
<|endoftext|>
Lawyer Elizabeth Beck was easy for me to beat. Ask her clients if they are happy with her results against me. Got total win and legal fees.
<|endoftext|>
Public Policy Polling (PPP) has just come out with a major poll putting me #1 with Hispanics - leading all Republican candidates.Told you so
<|endoftext|>
A nation WITHOUT BORDERS is not a nation at all. We must have a wall. The rule of law matters. Jeb just doesn’t get it.
<|endoftext|>
While I’m beating my opponents in the polls, I’m also beating lobbyists, special interests &amp, donors that are supporting them with billions.

“Government's first duty is to protect the people, not run their lives.” – Ronald Reagan
<|endoftext|>
Obama’s nuclear deal with the Iranians will lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. It has to be stopped.
<|endoftext|>
.#IranDeal will go down as one of the dumbest &amp, most dangerous misjudgments ever entered into in history of our country—incompetent leader!
<|endoftext|>
After all is said and done, more is said than done. -- Aesop
<|endoftext|>
Boston's Mayor Walsh wasted a lot of time and money on going for the Olympics, and then he gave up. I don't want him negotiating for me!
<|endoftext|>
Be in Turnberry on Thurs AM for start of Women's British Open, one of  world's great golf tournaments. Back soon to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
<|endoftext|>
I own Turnberry, in Scotland, one of great resorts in world. Women’s British Open there this week. I’ll go for two days &amp, back on trail.
<|endoftext|>
When people find out how bad a job Scott Walker has done in WI, they won’t be voting for him. Massive deficit, bad jobs forecast, a mess.
<|endoftext|>
Great news, I’m now leading in most polls w/ new CNN poll also having me #1. NBC, I am #1 in NH by a lot, #2 in Iowa, close &amp, gaining.
<|endoftext|>
Great success in Iowa today. Fantastic sold out crowd. Will be back soon!
<|endoftext|>
The ultra liberal and seriously failing Des Moines Register is BEGGING my team for press credentials to my event in Iowa today-but they lie!
<|endoftext|>
Getting ready to go to Iowa today. Big crowd - will be a great day!
<|endoftext|>
I love Bluffton, SC, what a great place -- what great people.
<|endoftext|>
When will anyone be held accountable for the VA scandal? The politicians are experts in never facing any consequence.
<|endoftext|>
Thoughts &amp, prayers with everyone in Lafayette, Louisiana this evening.
<|endoftext|>
Getting ready to lift off for Laredo. Will land at 1:OO P.M. Should be exciting and informative!
<|endoftext|>
Shouldn’t George Will have to give a disclaimer every time he is on Fox that his wife works for Scott Walker?
<|endoftext|>
Obama still will keep all military recruitment centers &amp, bases Gun Free Zones! It has to stop. MILITARY LIVES MATTER!
<|endoftext|>
I'm going to the BORDER tomorrow. Will be seeing some really brave people. Look forward to a big day!
<|endoftext|>
I hear a failing New York newspaper is going to publish one of my old cell phone numbers. So original - just one of many!
<|endoftext|>
Great day today in South Carolina. Fantastic capacity crowd, amazing people!
<|endoftext|>
I'm glad President Obama followed my lead and lowered the flags half-staff. It's about time!
<|endoftext|>
Rick Perry did an absolutely horrible job of securing the border. He should be ashamed of himself. Gov. Abbott has since been terrific.
<|endoftext|>
Good luck to my new friends on your testimony in DC. You are amazing people doing something so important--- stopping illegal immigration!
<|endoftext|>
Just got great national poll numbers - double digit lead!  Thank you, we will all MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
This story is no longer about John McCain, it’s about our horribly treated vets. Illegals are treated better than our wonderful veterans.
<|endoftext|>
"It was only after I informed NBC that I wouldn't do the Apprentice that they became upset w/ me. They couldn’t care less about “inclusion"""
<|endoftext|>
Isn’t it interesting that now that I’m #1 in the polls, the networks show polls that are a month old!
<|endoftext|>
We will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans.
<|endoftext|>
I will be making some very big campaign stops next week - big crowds and tremendous  energy!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
<|endoftext|>
The Republican Party must get tougher and smarter, and fast, or it will go down to a very big defeat - just like the last two times!
<|endoftext|>
The Veterans Administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly. John McCain has done nothing to help them but talk.
<|endoftext|>
"John McCain called thousands of people ""crazies"" when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in Phoenix. He owes apology!"
<|endoftext|>
One of the reasons I am no fan of John McCain is that our Vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians. I will fix VA quickly.
<|endoftext|>
I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept.
<|endoftext|>
....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care.
<|endoftext|>
It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans.....
<|endoftext|>
I will make this right for our great Vets!
<|endoftext|>
All he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything.
<|endoftext|>
....John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives.
<|endoftext|>
The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years...
<|endoftext|>
Captured or not, all our soldiers are heroes!
<|endoftext|>
In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets, John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President!
<|endoftext|>
Just left Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, got a standing ovation from many wonderful people. I will be back soon.
<|endoftext|>
I am now in Iowa getting ready to speak. People are always amazed to find out that I am Protestant (Presbyterian). GREAT.
<|endoftext|>
Made a speech in Arkansas last night before a record GOP crowd. Great spirit and amazing people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
MILITARY LIVES MATTER! END GUN FREE ZONES! OUR SOLDIERS MUST BE ABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES! THIS HAS TO STOP!
<|endoftext|>
Get rid of gun free zones. The four great marines who were just shot never had a chance. They were highly trained but helpless without guns.
<|endoftext|>
Thoughts and prayers to the families of the four great Marines killed today.
<|endoftext|>
“No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. So governments' programs, once launched, never disappear.” – Ronald Reagan
<|endoftext|>
Leaving for New Hampshire now. Making a speech—packed house.  Love it!
<|endoftext|>
The Iran deal poses a direct national security threat. It must be stopped in Congress. Stand up Republicans!
<|endoftext|>
No deal is better than a bad deal. America out negotiated again.  #Iran

Getting ready to land in Charlottesville, Virginia, at Trump Vineyards, another job producing development that I bought and made AMAZING!
<|endoftext|>
I can't believe that President Obama isn't able or willing to make just one phone call to the family of Kate Steinle.Come on Pres-MAKE CALL!
<|endoftext|>
Let Pete Rose into the Baseball Hall of Fame. It's time, he has paid a big and very long price!
<|endoftext|>
I absolutely support Kate’s Law—in honor of the beautiful Kate Steinle who was gunned down in SF by an illegal immigrant.
<|endoftext|>
Mexico’s totally corrupt gov’t looks horrible with El Chapo’s escape—totally corrupt. U.S. paid them $3 billion.
<|endoftext|>
The joke around town is that I freed El Chapo from the Mexican prison because the timing was so good w/ my statements on border security.
<|endoftext|>
"When will people, and the media, start to apologize to me for my statement, ""Mexico is sending...."", which turned out to be true?  El Chapo"
<|endoftext|>
....likewise, billions of dollars gets brought into Mexico    through the border. We get the killers, drugs &amp, crime, they get the money!
<|endoftext|>
El Chapo and the Mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a  vacuum cleaner, sucking drugs and death right into the U.S.
<|endoftext|>
"The U.S. will invite El Chapo, the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison, to become a U.S. citizen because our ""leaders"" can't say no!"
<|endoftext|>
.....but that's what I've been saying. Very unfair treatment by the media!
<|endoftext|>
Now that the Mexican drug lord escaped from prison, everyone is saying that most of the cocaine etc. coming into the U.S. comes over border!
<|endoftext|>
...Trump, however, would kick his ass!
<|endoftext|>
Can you envision Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton negotiating with 'El Chapo', the Mexican drug lord who escaped from prison? ....
<|endoftext|>
Mexico's biggest drug lord escapes from jail. Unbelievable corruption and USA is paying the price.  I told you so!
<|endoftext|>
Phoenix Convention Center officials did not want to have thousands of people standing outside in the heat, so they let them in. A GREAT day!
<|endoftext|>
Convention Center officials in Phoenix don't want to admit that they broke the fire code by allowing 12-15,000 people in 4,000 code room.
<|endoftext|>
I will not be able to attend the Miss USA pageant tomorrow night because I am campaigning in Phoenix. Wishing all well!
<|endoftext|>
Getting ready to go to Las Vegas (Freedom Fest) - great crowd. Then on to amazing Phoenix - that will be a total happening! Love America.
<|endoftext|>
Look forward to being in Phoenix tomorrow at 2:00 P.M. Hottest ticket in entire country. Was supposed to be 500 people, now many thousands!
<|endoftext|>
Jeb Bush just announced he raised over $100M. Everyone of those people who contributed are getting something to the detriment of America!
<|endoftext|>
Iran continues to delay the nuclear deal while doing many bad things behind our backs. Time to WALK and double the sanctions. Stop payments!
<|endoftext|>
Obama and Republicans are hollowing out our military. Now want to cut troop levels. Lowest level in over 20 years.
<|endoftext|>
You mean George Bush sends our soldiers into combat, they are severely wounded, and then he wants $120,000 to make a boring speech to them?
<|endoftext|>
Jeb's brother George insisted on a $100,000 fee and $20,000 for a private jet to speak at a charity for severely wounded vets. Not nice!
<|endoftext|>
I will be in California this weekend making a speech for Clint Eastwood. Then to Arizona and Vegas. Big crowds. Discussing illegals &amp, more!
<|endoftext|>
People rarely say that many conservatives didn’t vote for Mitt Romney. If I can get them to vote for me, we win in a landslide.
<|endoftext|>
We have got to take our country back. It's time!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you Alabama! #Trump2016#SuperTuesday
<|endoftext|>
I said simply that the Mexican leaders and negotiators are smarter than ours and that the Mexican gov't is pushing their hard core to U.S.
<|endoftext|>
Jeb Bush will never secure our border or negotiate great trade deals for American workers. Jeb doesn't see &amp, can't solve the problems.
<|endoftext|>
I appreciate the GOP candidates who remain strong on border security. They know I am right. A nation without borders cannot survive.
<|endoftext|>
Rick Perry failed at the border. Now he is critical of me. He needs a new pair of glasses to see the crimes committed by illegal immigrants.
<|endoftext|>
Miss Universe, Paulina Vega, criticized me for telling the truth about illegal immigration, but then said she would keep the crown-Hypocrite
<|endoftext|>
Why would Republican candidates want the support of Mitt Romney. He lost an election against Obama that should NEVER have been lost!
<|endoftext|>
What about the undocumented immigrant with a record who killed the beautiful young women (in front of her father) in San Fran. Get smart!
<|endoftext|>
HAPPY 4TH OF JULY TO EVERYONE!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
My heartfelt condolences to the family of Kathryn Steinle. Very, very sad!
<|endoftext|>
"""A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation."" - President Ronald Reagan"
<|endoftext|>
Wow, Huffington Post just stated that I am number 1 in the polls of Republican candidates. Thank you, but the work has just begun!
<|endoftext|>
Mexican leaders and negotiators are much tougher and smarter than those of the U.S. Mexico is killing us on jobs and trade. WAKE UP!
<|endoftext|>
Obama once again just missed a self-imposed deadline with Iran. Our leadership is weak &amp, ineffective. Double the sanctions!
<|endoftext|>
I love the Mexican people, but Mexico is not our friend. They're killing us at the border and they're killing us on jobs and trade. FIGHT!
<|endoftext|>
We MUST have strong borders and stop illegal immigration. Without that we do not have a country. Also, Mexico is killing U.S. on trade. WIN!
<|endoftext|>
Remember, Univision apologized!
<|endoftext|>
Univision apologized to me but I will not accept their apology. I will be suing them for a lot of money. Miss U.S.A. contestants are hurt!
<|endoftext|>
See story in Fusion and Huff. Post about rape at the border. Beyond terrible! Isn't Fusion owned by Univision?
<|endoftext|>
Will be in Chicago tomorrow for a record setting (by far) luncheon.
<|endoftext|>
I'll be in Iowa tonight making a speech to a record setting crowd. The word is getting out, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
The leader and negotiators representing Mexico are far smarter and more cunning than the leader and negotiators representing the U.S.!
<|endoftext|>
Only very stupid people think that the United States is making good trade deals with Mexico.Mexico is killing us at the border and at trade!
<|endoftext|>
When you are in a war, or even a battle, losing is not an option!

If I win the presidency, my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike Bush's appointee John Roberts on ObamaCare.
<|endoftext|>
Once again the Bush appointed  Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has let us down. Jeb pushed him hard! Remember!

I love Mexico but not the unfair trade deals that the US so stupidly makes with them. Really bad for US jobs, only good for Mexico.
<|endoftext|>
Mexican gov doesn't want me talking about terrible border situation &amp, horrible trade deals. Forcing Univision to get me to stop- no way!
<|endoftext|>
Governor Rick Scott of Florida did really poorly on television this morning. I hope he is O.K.

I hear that dopey political pundit, Lawrence O'Donnell, one of the dumber people on television, is about to lose his show-no ratings?Too bad

We have to bring back and cherish the middle class - once the backbone and true strength of the U.S.A. It can happen!

My message, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, is beginning to take hold. Bring back our jobs, strengthen our military and borders, help our VETS!

My daughter Ivanka did great tonight in New Hampshire. The sold out crowd loved her, and she loved them. Thanks Ivanka!

"I am really beginning to respect Mark Halperin and John Heilemann as political reporters - they truly get why ""Trump"" poll numbers are high."

Uncomfortable looking NBC reporter Willie Geist calls me to ask for favors and then mockingly smiles when he is told of my high poll numbers

My daughter, Ivanka, will be representing me today at the opening of our campaign office in Manchester, NH  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!

Who would you rather have negotiating for the U.S. against Putin, Iran, China, etc., Donald Trump or Hillary? Is there even a little doubt?
<|endoftext|>
My speech is right now on C-SPAN 1
<|endoftext|>
Druggies, drug dealers, rapists and killers are coming across the southern border. When will the U.S. get smart and stop this travesty?
<|endoftext|>
Mexico is killing the United States economically because their leaders and negotiators are FAR smarter than ours. But nobody beats Trump!
<|endoftext|>
I like Mexico and love the spirit of  Mexican people, but we must protect our borders from people, from all over, pouring into the U.S.
<|endoftext|>
Our country is in a major crisis of incompetent leadership. We cannot continue to go on with these politicians who do nothing but talk.
<|endoftext|>
Out of hundreds of deals &amp, transactions, I have used the bankruptcy laws a few times to make deals better. Nothing personal, just business.
<|endoftext|>
Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool. Icahn, Black, Zell—but nobody says they went bankrupt!
<|endoftext|>
People buy deals &amp, immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals. It’s a very effective &amp, commonly used business tool.
<|endoftext|>
Stop saying I went bankrupt. I never went bankrupt but like many great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage—smart!
<|endoftext|>
George Will was a big Iraq fool.  $2 trillion, thousands of lives lost -- &amp, we got nothing! Dummy.

<|endoftext|>
Huckabee is a nice guy but will never be able to bring in the funds so as not to cut Social Security, Medicare &amp, Medicaid. I will.
<|endoftext|>
I was the first &amp, only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare &amp, Medicaid. Huckabee copied me.
<|endoftext|>
If I run, I will be in all the primary debates and you will see why I am the only one who can Make America Great Again!
<|endoftext|>
The United States needs great deals - and fast. We have to make our country rich again in order to MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN!

The U.S. has enough problems without publicity seekers going out and openly mocking religion in order to provoke attacks and death. BE SMART
<|endoftext|>
Nobody would fight harder for free speech than me but why  taunt, over and over again, in order to provoke possible death to audience. DUMB!

If the working, proud and productive people of our country don't start exerting their authority and views, the U.S. as we know it is doomed!
<|endoftext|>
Why is no-one talking about the horrible murder of Ana Charle by ex-con thug West Spruill. Gunned down on street, naked. Why no riots here?
<|endoftext|>
Billions of dollars spent on Baltimore and it's still a total mess. Leadership is needed, not dollars. Our whole country is going to hell!
<|endoftext|>
I have been a guest on The View many times when it was  successful show. Now the show is dying for lack of ratings. Too bad!
<|endoftext|>
"They now say using the word ""thug"" is, like so many other words, not politically correct (even though Obama uses it). It is racist. BULL!"

I am going to Iowa today - sold out crowds. People don't want our country ripped-off anymore. Must stop now!
<|endoftext|>
I wonder what the rest of the world is thinking about the United States as they watch the disgusting and out of control Baltimore riots?
<|endoftext|>
Hopefully there won't be any problems in Baltimore tonight. Be calm, be cool-do not let anybody get hurt.There is just too much to live for!
<|endoftext|>
The best social program, by far, is a JOB! Our jobs are being taken away from us by China and many other countries - incompetent leader.
<|endoftext|>
President Obama, you have a big job to do. Go to Baltimore and bring both sides together. With proper leadership, it can be done! Do it.
<|endoftext|>
Our country has to come together. We have to start working with, and really liking,  each other. The whole world is watching Baltimore.
<|endoftext|>
"The Mayor of Baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters ""space to destroy"" - another real genius!"
<|endoftext|>
Now that the ineffective Baltimore  Police have allowed the city to be destroyed, are the U.S. taxpayers expected to rebuild it (again)?
<|endoftext|>
Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!
<|endoftext|>
Blatant and rampant property destruction in Baltimore as the police stand by and watch. Should be a lesson on how NOT to handle riots. SAD!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, 15 policemen hurt in Baltimore, some badly! Where is the National Guard. Police must get tough, and fast! Thugs must be stopped.
<|endoftext|>
Nobody but Donald Trump will save Israel. You are wasting your time with these politicians and political clowns. Best! #SheldonAdelson

How do you take care of our people if you don't make anything? We don't make anything. We are rapidly losing our manufacturing to China etc.

China has a backdoor into the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This deal does not address currency manipulation. China is laughing at us.
<|endoftext|>
The Trans-Pacific Partnership will lead to even greater unemployment. Do not pass it.
<|endoftext|>
Republicans should not be giving Obama fast track authority on trade. The Trans-Pacific Partnership will squeeze our manufacturing sector
<|endoftext|>
The Trans-Pacific Partnership is an attack on America's business. It does not  stop Japan's currency manipulation. This is a bad deal.
<|endoftext|>
I want to negotiate my own, and much better, trade deals for our country. MUST INCLUDE CURRENCY MANIPULATION (and more). DO NOT LET PASS!
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations to the Republicans in Congress. You are the only people Obama can out negotiate. #TimeToGetTough

<|endoftext|>
As I have long been saying, South Africa is a total - and very dangerous - mess. Just watch the evening news (when not talking weather).
<|endoftext|>
We are stupidly paying Iran billions of dollars that we should not be paying. Why isn't this part of the nuclear negotiations? Really dumb!
<|endoftext|>
We are getting ready to protect Saudi Arabia against Iran &amp, others-sending ships.  How much are they going to pay us toward this protection.
<|endoftext|>
Just returned from New Hampshire where the crowd was great-and got a beautiful standing ovation! Wonderful people who truly love the U.S.A.

For all of the haters and losers out there sorry, I never went Bankrupt -- but I did build a world class company and employ many people!

I will be LIVE tweeting tomorrow (MONDAY) nights TWO shows starting at 8:00 P.M. They are both great.
<|endoftext|>
This show was taped just before the terrible Bill Cosby revelations came to light.She still should have asked him for money-goes to charity.
<|endoftext|>
Hope you liked it. Tune in tomorrow night at 8:00 and 9:00 for two episodes and two boardrooms! Will be a great evening of television!
<|endoftext|>
How do you like the boardroom so far?
<|endoftext|>
This boardroom gets CRAZY! These people are wild
<|endoftext|>
Who do you like - hate so far?
<|endoftext|>
It's still exciting after all these years - and this cast is special!
<|endoftext|>
This is going to be a special season - truly great characters and cast. You will soon see!
<|endoftext|>
Everyone is asking me to cover The Apprentice LIVE on twitter. I will do so. Tonight 9 to 11. IT WILL BE A GREAT EVENING OF TELEVISION!
<|endoftext|>
I will be commenting LIVE on Sunday night (9 to 11) on TWITTER - Celebrity Apprentice will be great this season - amazing cast!
<|endoftext|>
"I just saw the movie ""Unbroken"" -- very good except I thought the ending was weak, no retribution! And we complain about waterboarding."
<|endoftext|>
The Mar-a-Lago Club was amazing tonight. Everybody was there, the biggest and the hottest. Palm Beach is so lucky to have best club in world
<|endoftext|>
Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love!
<|endoftext|>
Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!
<|endoftext|>
not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!
<|endoftext|>
We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but.......
<|endoftext|>
Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT!
<|endoftext|>
The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points to 113.7, THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN 15 YEARS! Thanks Donald!
<|endoftext|>
President Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states, and lost.The voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!
<|endoftext|>
I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won't report!
<|endoftext|>
The world was gloomy before I won - there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars!
<|endoftext|>
The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad!
<|endoftext|>
President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc.
<|endoftext|>
Merry Christmas and a very, very, very , very Happy New Year to everyone!
<|endoftext|>
The big loss yesterday for Israel in the United Nations will make it much harder to negotiate peace.Too bad, but we will get it done anyway!
<|endoftext|>
"Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: ""In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity.""  So true!"
<|endoftext|>
slaughter you. This is a purely religious threat, which turned into reality. Such hatred! When will the U.S., and all countries, fight back?
<|endoftext|>
"The terrorist who killed so many people in Germany said just before crime, ""by God's will we will slaughter you pigs, I swear, we will......"
<|endoftext|>
As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.
<|endoftext|>
my presidency. Isn't this a ridiculous shame? He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. Wrong answer!
<|endoftext|>
My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with...
<|endoftext|>
"The so-called ""A"" list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE!"
<|endoftext|>
Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!
<|endoftext|>
The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes
<|endoftext|>
"Someone incorrectly stated that the phrase ""DRAIN THE SWAMP"" was no longer being used by me. Actually, we will always be trying to DTS."
<|endoftext|>
I met some really great Air Force GENERALS and Navy ADMIRALS today, talking about airplane capability and pricing. Very impressive people!
<|endoftext|>
I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss!
<|endoftext|>
I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently
<|endoftext|>
Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult &amp, sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states!
<|endoftext|>
Yes, it is true - Carlos Slim, the great businessman from Mexico, called me about getting together for a meeting. We met, HE IS A GREAT GUY!
<|endoftext|>
especially how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more). They focused on wrong states
<|endoftext|>
"Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election. Wrong, he called me (with a very nice congratulations). He ""doesn't know much"" ..."
<|endoftext|>
We did it! Thank you to all of my great supporters, we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media).
<|endoftext|>
Today there were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking!
<|endoftext|>
If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned &amp, called terrible names!
<|endoftext|>
We should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it!
<|endoftext|>
China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act.
<|endoftext|>
"Mobile, Alabama today at 3:00 P.M. Last rally of the year - ""THANK YOU ALABAMA AND THE SOUTH"" Biggest of all crowds expected, see you there!"
<|endoftext|>
Last night in Orlando, Florida, was incredible - massive crowd - THANK YOU FLORIDA! Today at 3:00 P.M. I will be in Alabama for last rally!
<|endoftext|>
"Well, we all did it, together! I hope the ""MOVEMENT"" fans will go to D.C. on Jan 20th for the swearing in. Let's set the all time record!"
<|endoftext|>
Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate?
<|endoftext|>
If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?
<|endoftext|>
The media tries so hard to make my move to the White House, as it pertains to my business, so complex - when actually it isn't!
<|endoftext|>
"Thank you to Time Magazine and Financial Times for naming me ""Person of the Year"" - a great honor!"
<|endoftext|>
The thing I like best about Rex Tillerson is that he has vast experience at dealing successfully with all types of foreign governments.
<|endoftext|>
Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have just certified my wins in those states. I actually picked up additional votes!
<|endoftext|>
I have chosen one of the truly great business leaders of the world, Rex Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, to be Secretary of State.
<|endoftext|>
I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times!
<|endoftext|>
Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office.
<|endoftext|>
Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the......
<|endoftext|>
I will be making my announcement on the next Secretary of State tomorrow morning.
<|endoftext|>
The final Wisconsin vote is in and guess what - we just picked up an additional 131 votes. The Dems and Green Party can now rest. Scam!
<|endoftext|>
The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.
<|endoftext|>
"Unless you catch ""hackers"" in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election?"
<|endoftext|>
Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!
<|endoftext|>
"Whether I choose him or not for ""State""- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman &amp, CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned!"
<|endoftext|>
I spent Friday campaigning with John Kennedy, of the Great State of Louisiana, for the U.S.Senate. The election is over - JOHN WON!
<|endoftext|>
Being at the Army - Navy Game was fantastic. There is nothing like the spirit in that stadium. A wonderful experience, and congrats to Army!
<|endoftext|>
I will be interviewed today on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace at 10:00 (Eastern) Network. ENJOY!
<|endoftext|>
As a show of support for our Armed Forces, I will be going to The Army-Navy Game today. Looking forward to it, should be fun!
<|endoftext|>
I have NOTHING to do with The Apprentice except for fact that I conceived it with Mark B &amp, have a big stake in it. Will devote ZERO TIME!
<|endoftext|>
Today we lost a great pioneer of air and space in John Glenn. He was a hero and inspired generations of future explorers. He will be missed.
<|endoftext|>
If United Steelworkers 1999 was any good, they would have kept those jobs in Indiana. Spend more time working-less time talking. Reduce dues
<|endoftext|>
Chuck Jones, who is President of United Steelworkers 1999, has done a terrible job representing workers. No wonder companies flee country!
<|endoftext|>
Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!
<|endoftext|>
Masa (SoftBank) of Japan has agreed to invest $50 billion in the U.S. toward businesses and 50,000 new jobs....
<|endoftext|>
Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!
<|endoftext|>
"If the press would cover me accurately &amp, honorably, I would have far less reason to ""tweet."" Sadly, I don't know if that will ever happen!"
<|endoftext|>
their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?  I don't think so!
<|endoftext|>
Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into..
<|endoftext|>
The Green Party just dropped its recount suit in Pennsylvania and is losing votes in Wisconsin recount. Just a Stein scam to raise money!
<|endoftext|>
expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS
<|endoftext|>
these companies are able to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged. Please be forewarned prior to making a very ...
<|endoftext|>
wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units etc., back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but.....
<|endoftext|>
without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies ......
<|endoftext|>
fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S.  ......
<|endoftext|>
The U.S. is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country,
<|endoftext|>
Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad
<|endoftext|>
State Treasurer John Kennedy is my choice for US Senator from Louisiana. Early voting today, election next Saturday.
<|endoftext|>
Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!
<|endoftext|>
Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.
<|endoftext|>
The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!
<|endoftext|>
Getting ready to leave for the Great State of Indiana and meet the hard working and wonderful people of Carrier A.C.
<|endoftext|>
My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by the tragic storms and tornadoes in the Southeastern United States. Stay safe!
<|endoftext|>
Look forward to going to Indiana tomorrow in order to be with the great workers of Carrier. They will sell many air conditioners!
<|endoftext|>
Hence, legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task!
<|endoftext|>
do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President,  to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses..
<|endoftext|>
great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! While I am not mandated to ....
<|endoftext|>
I will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my ...
<|endoftext|>
ISIS is taking credit for the terrible stabbing attack at Ohio State University by a Somali refugee who should not have been in our country.
<|endoftext|>
Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state.We will keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks Carrier
<|endoftext|>
I will be going to Indiana on Thursday to make a major announcement concerning Carrier A.C. staying in Indianapolis. Great deal for workers!
<|endoftext|>
My thoughts and prayers are with the great people of Tennessee during these terrible wildfires. Stay safe!
<|endoftext|>
Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!
<|endoftext|>
The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory - 306!
<|endoftext|>
If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal.
<|endoftext|>
Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!
<|endoftext|>
states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!
<|endoftext|>
It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4--
<|endoftext|>
In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally
<|endoftext|>
"Trump is going to be our President. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead."" So much time and money will be spent - same result! Sad"
<|endoftext|>
"this election. That is a direct threat to our democracy."" She then said, ""We have to accept the results and look to the future, Donald --"
<|endoftext|>
"of position."" Then, separately she stated, ""He said something truly horrifying ... he refused to say that he would respect the results of --"
<|endoftext|>
during a general election. I, for one, am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind --
<|endoftext|>
and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them, and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a -
<|endoftext|>
"Hillary's debate answer on delay: ""That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works. Been around for 240 years. We've had free --"
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats, when they incorrectly thought they were going to win, asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore!
<|endoftext|>
The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated &amp, demoralized Dems
<|endoftext|>
Fidel Castro is dead!
<|endoftext|>
I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!
<|endoftext|>
Happy Thanksgiving to everyone. We will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Bus crash in Tennessee so sad &amp, so terrible. Condolences to all family members and loved ones. These beautiful children will be remembered!
<|endoftext|>
I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I've gotten to know him well--he's a greatly talented person who loves people!
<|endoftext|>
Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years.
<|endoftext|>
Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world.Only the crooked media makes this a big deal!
<|endoftext|>
I have always had a good relationship with Chuck Schumer. He is far smarter than Harry R and has the ability to get things done. Good news!
<|endoftext|>
"General James ""Mad Dog"" Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General!"
<|endoftext|>
Numerous patriots will be coming to Bedminster today as I continue to fill out the various positions necessary to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior
<|endoftext|>
The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!
<|endoftext|>
Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!
<|endoftext|>
The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!
<|endoftext|>
I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.
<|endoftext|>
Will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!
<|endoftext|>
Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico
<|endoftext|>
My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
"I am not trying to get ""top level security clearance"" for my children. This was a typically false news story."
<|endoftext|>
Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!
<|endoftext|>
The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!
<|endoftext|>
If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in  N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily
<|endoftext|>
The debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win!
<|endoftext|>
Governor John Kasich of the GREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win. The people of Ohio were incredible!
<|endoftext|>
Jeb Bush, George W and George H.W. all called to express their best wishes on the win. Very nice!
<|endoftext|>
Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice!
<|endoftext|>
This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win!
<|endoftext|>
Busy day planned in New York. Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government!
<|endoftext|>
Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!
<|endoftext|>
Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!
<|endoftext|>
A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!
<|endoftext|>
Such a beautiful and important evening! The forgotten man and woman will never be forgotten again. We will all come together as never before
<|endoftext|>
Don't let up, keep getting out to vote - this election is FAR FROM OVER! We are doing well but there is much time left. GO FLORIDA!
<|endoftext|>
I will be watching the election results from Trump Tower in Manhattan with my family and friends. Very exciting!
<|endoftext|>
TODAY WE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Big news to share in New Hampshire tonight! Polls looking great! See you soon.
<|endoftext|>
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
If Obama worked as hard on straightening out our country as he has trying to protect and elect Hillary, we would all be much better off!
<|endoftext|>
ObamaCare is a total disaster. Hillary Clinton wants to save it by making it even more expensive. Doesn't work, I will REPEAL AND REPLACE!
<|endoftext|>
My wife, Melania, will be speaking in Pennsylvania this afternoon. So exciting, big crowds! I will be watching from North Carolina.
<|endoftext|>
Praying for the families of the two Iowa police who were ambushed this morning. An attack on those who keep us safe is an attack on us all.
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 e-mails AFTER they were subpoenaed by the United States Congress. Guilty - cannot run. Rigged system!
<|endoftext|>
I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare. We will have MUCH less expensive and MUCH better healthcare. With Hillary, costs will triple!
<|endoftext|>
You can change your vote in six states. So, now that you see that Hillary was a big mistake, change your vote to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
So terrible that Crooked didn't report she got the debate questions from Donna Brazile, if that were me it would have been front page news!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary should not be allowed to run for president. She deleted 33,000 e-mails AFTER getting a subpoena from U.S. Congress. RIGGED!
<|endoftext|>
Look at the way Crooked Hillary is handling the e-mail case and the total mess she is in. She is unfit to be president. Bad judgement!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary and the Dems loved and praised FBI Director Comey just a few days ago. Original evidence was overwhelming, should not have delayed!
<|endoftext|>
We are now leading in many polls, and many of these were taken before the criminal investigation announcement on Friday - great in states!
<|endoftext|>
I am in Colorado - big day planned - but nothing can be as big as yesterday!
<|endoftext|>
Just out: Neera Tanden, Hillary Clinton adviser said, “Israel is depressing.” I think Israel is inspiring!
<|endoftext|>
Heading to New Hampshire. Will be talking about the disaster known as ObamaCare!
<|endoftext|>
"If my people said the things about me that Podesta &amp, Hillary's people said about her, I would fire them out of self respect. ""Bad instincts"""
<|endoftext|>
A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?
<|endoftext|>
REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE!
<|endoftext|>
REPEAL AND REPLACE!!! #ObamaCareInThreeWords
<|endoftext|>
Obamacare is a disaster. Rates going through the sky - ready to explode. I will fix it. Hillary can't!#ObamacareFailed
<|endoftext|>
We are winning and the press is refusing to report it. Don't let them fool you- get out and vote! #DrainTheSwamp on November 8th!
<|endoftext|>
Why has nobody asked Kaine about the horrible views emanated on WikiLeaks about Catholics? Media in the tank for Clinton but Trump will win!
<|endoftext|>
Major story that the Dems are making up phony polls in order to suppress the the Trump . We are going to WIN!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, just came out on secret tape that Crooked Hillary wants to take in as many Syrians as possible. We cannot let this happen - ISIS!
<|endoftext|>
The attack on Mosul is turning out to be a total disaster. We gave them months of notice. U.S. is looking so dumb. VOTE TRUMP and WIN AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Well, Iran has done it again. Taken two of our people and asking for a fortune for their release. This doesn't happen if I'm president!
<|endoftext|>
"""If you can't run your own house you certainly can't run the White House"" A statement made by Mrs. Obama about Crooked Hillary Clinton"
<|endoftext|>
Will be at the Women's U.S. Open today!
<|endoftext|>
The media refuses to talk about the three new national polls that have me in first place. Biggest crowds ever - watch what happens!
<|endoftext|>
Just returned from Pennsylvania where we will be bringing back their jobs. Amazing crowd. Will be going back tomorrow, to Gettysburg!
<|endoftext|>
The results are in on the final debate and it is almost unanimous, I WON! Thank you, these are very exciting times.
<|endoftext|>
When Obama took office in 2009 employer-provided premiums cost $13,375. Today they are $18,142. Thanks, Obama.
<|endoftext|>
Why didn't Hillary Clinton announce that she was inappropriately given the debate questions - she secretly used them! Crooked Hillary.
<|endoftext|>
That was really exciting. Made all of my points. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama and that’s what you’ll get if you vote for Hillary. #BigLeagueTruth
<|endoftext|>
I started this campaign to Make America Great Again. That’s what I’m going to do. #MAGA #debate

USA has the greatest business people in the world but we let political hacks negotiate our deals. We need change! #BigLeagueTruth #Debate

Our country is stagnant. We’ve lost jobs and business. We don’t make things anymore b/c of the bill Hillary’s husband signed and she blessed
<|endoftext|>
I will renegotiate NAFTA. If I can’t make a great deal, we’re going to tear it up. We’re going to get this economy running again. #Debate
<|endoftext|>
Moderator: Hillary plan calls for more regulation and more government spending. #Debate #BigLeagueTruth
<|endoftext|>
Moderator: Hillary paid $225,000 by a Brazilian bank for a speech that called for “open borders.” That’s a quote! #Debate #BigLeagueTruth
<|endoftext|>
Hillary is too weak to lead on border security-no solutions, no ideas, no credibility.She supported NAFTA, worst deal in US history. #Debate
<|endoftext|>
One of my first acts as President will be to deport the drug lords and then secure the border. #Debate #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
Drugs are pouring into this country. If we have no border, we have no country. That’s why ICE endorsed me. #Debate #BigLeagueTruth

The 2nd Amendment is under siege. We need SCOTUS judges who will uphold the US Constitution. #Debate #BigLeagueTruth

Ready to lead. Ready to Make America Great Again. #Debate #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
I will be handing over my Twitter account to my team of deplorables for tonight's #debate#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
<|endoftext|>
I will sign the first bill to repeal #Obamacare and give Americans many choices and much lower rates!
<|endoftext|>
New polls are good because the media has deceived the public by putting women front and center with made-up stories and lies, and got caught
<|endoftext|>
Voter fraud! Crooked Hillary Clinton even got the questions to a debate, and nobody says a word. Can you imagine if I got the questions?
<|endoftext|>
We have all got to come together and win this election. We can't have four more years of Obama (or worse!).
<|endoftext|>
Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!
<|endoftext|>
Can't believe these totally phoney stories, 100% made up by women (many already proven false) and pushed big time by press, have impact!
<|endoftext|>
"Wow, interview released by Wikileakes shows ""quid pro quo"" in Crooked Hillary e-mail probe.Such a dishonest person - &amp, Paul Ryan does zilch!"
<|endoftext|>
Finally, in the new ABC News/Washington Post Poll, Hillary Clinton is down 11 points with WOMEN VOTERS and the election is close at 47-43!
<|endoftext|>
Paul Ryan, a man who doesn't know how to win (including failed run four years ago), must start focusing on the budget, military, vets etc.
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats have a corrupt political machine pushing crooked Hillary Clinton. We have Paul Ryan, always fighting the Republican nominee!
<|endoftext|>
The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD
<|endoftext|>
Election is being rigged by the media, in a coordinated effort with the Clinton campaign, by putting stories that never happened into news!
<|endoftext|>
Polls close, but can you believe I lost large numbers of women voters based on made up events THAT NEVER HAPPENED. Media rigging election!
<|endoftext|>
Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me.Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!
<|endoftext|>
A great day in New Hampshire and Maine. Fantastic crowds and energy! #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
Big wins against ISIS!
<|endoftext|>
Nothing ever happened with any of these women. Totally made up nonsense to steal the election. Nobody has more respect for women than me!
<|endoftext|>
Landing in New Hampshire soon to talk about the massive drug problem there, and all over the country.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail. Instead she is running for president in what looks like a rigged election
<|endoftext|>
This election is being rigged by the media pushing false and unsubstantiated charges, and outright lies, in order to elect Crooked Hillary!
<|endoftext|>
100% fabricated and made-up charges, pushed strongly by the media and the Clinton Campaign, may poison the minds of the American Voter. FIX!
<|endoftext|>
Dem Gov. of MN. just announced that the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is no longer affordable. I've been saying this for years- disaster!
<|endoftext|>
Great event in Columbus- taking off for Cincinnati now. Great new Ohio poll out- thank you!OHIO NBC/WSJ/MARIST POLLTrump 42% Clinton 41%
<|endoftext|>
Just left a great rally in Florida - now heading to Ohio for two more. Will be there soon.
<|endoftext|>
I am making a major speech in West Palm Beach, Florida at noon. Tune in!
<|endoftext|>
"Why didn't the writer of the twelve year old article in People Magazine mention the ""incident"" in her story. Because it did not happen!"
<|endoftext|>
The people of Cuba have struggled too long. Will reverse Obama's Executive Orders and concessions towards Cuba until freedoms are restored.
<|endoftext|>
Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton likes to talk about the things she will do but she has been there for 30 years - why didn't she do them?
<|endoftext|>
I hope people are looking at the disgraceful behavior of Hillary Clinton as exposed by WikiLeaks. She is unfit to run.
<|endoftext|>
In Texas now, leaving soon for BIG rally in Florida!
<|endoftext|>
The very foul mouthed Sen. John McCain begged for my support during his  primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks!
<|endoftext|>
Disloyal R's are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary. They come at you from all sides. They don’t know how to win - I will teach them!
<|endoftext|>
With the exception of cheating Bernie out of the nom the Dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the Republicans!
<|endoftext|>
It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to.
<|endoftext|>
Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty.
<|endoftext|>
Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!
<|endoftext|>
Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee
<|endoftext|>
Thank you for all of the great comments on the debate last night. Very exciting!
<|endoftext|>
Our country has the slowest growth since 1929. #BigLeagueTruth #debate
<|endoftext|>
This country cannot take four more years of Barack Obama! #Debate
<|endoftext|>
In my administration, EVERY American will be treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally #Debate #BigLeagueTruth
<|endoftext|>
We must repeal Obamacare and replace it with a much more competitive, comprehensive, affordable system. #debate #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
Hillary’s 33,000 deleted emails about her daughter’s wedding. That’s a lot of wedding emails. #debate
<|endoftext|>
Basically nothing Hillary has said about her secret server has been true. #CrookedHillary
<|endoftext|>
If I win-I am going to instruct my AG to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation bc there's never been anything like your lies.
<|endoftext|>
There’s never been anyone more abusive to women in politics than Bill Clinton.My words were unfortunate-the Clintons’ actions were far worse
<|endoftext|>
I’m not proud of my locker room talk. But this world has serious problems. We need serious leaders. #debate #BigLeagueTruth
<|endoftext|>
It’s this simple. “Make America Great Again.” #debate #BigLeagueTruth
<|endoftext|>
My team of deplorables will be taking over my Twitter account for tonight's #debate#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
<|endoftext|>
So many self-righteous hypocrites. Watch their poll numbers - and elections - go down!
<|endoftext|>
"Tremendous support (except for some Republican ""leadership""). Thank you."
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to my great supporters in Wisconsin. I heard that the crowd and enthusiasm was unreal!
<|endoftext|>
The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly -  I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN! #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
Certainly has been an interesting 24 hours!
<|endoftext|>
Praying for everyone in Florida. Hoping the hurricane dissipates, but in any event, please be careful.
<|endoftext|>
EARLY VOTING: MN &amp, IA already underway, more states coming up in the next week: OH, ME, AZ, IN — check w/local officials for details &amp, VOTE!
<|endoftext|>
Bill Clinton is right: Obamacare is 'crazy', 'doesn't work' and 'doesn't make sense'.  Thanks Bill for telling the truth.
<|endoftext|>
The constant interruptions last night by Tim Kaine should not have been allowed. Mike Pence won big!
<|endoftext|>
Mike Pence won big. We should all be proud of Mike!
<|endoftext|>
Both are looking good! Now we begin!
<|endoftext|>
Here we go - Enjoy!
<|endoftext|>
I will be live-tweeting the V.P. Debate. Very exciting! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, did you just hear Bill Clinton's statement on how bad ObamaCare is. Hillary not happy. As I have been saying, REPEAL AND REPLACE!
<|endoftext|>
Just announced that Iraq (U.S.) is preparing for battle to reclaim Mosul. Why do they have to announce this? Makes mission much harder!
<|endoftext|>
Melania and I extend our warmest greetings to those observing Rosh Hashanah here in the United States, in Israel, and around the world.
<|endoftext|>
Bernie should pull his endorsement of Crooked Hillary after she decieved him and then attacked him and his supporters.
<|endoftext|>
I have created tens of thousands of jobs and will bring back great American prosperity. Hillary has only created jobs at the FBI and DOJ!
<|endoftext|>
Heading to Pennsylvania for a big rally tonight. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
The so-called Commission on Presidential Debates admitted to us that the DJT audio &amp, sound level was very bad. So why didn't they fix it?
<|endoftext|>
"I won the debate if you decide without watching the totally one-sided ""spin"" that followed. This despite the really bad microphone."
<|endoftext|>
For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o'clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!
<|endoftext|>
The people are really smart in cancelling subscriptions to the Dallas &amp, Arizona papers &amp, now USA Today will lose readers! The people get it!
<|endoftext|>
"Remember, don't believe ""sources said"" by the VERY dishonest media. If they don't name the sources, the sources don't exist."
<|endoftext|>
Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?
<|endoftext|>
Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con.
<|endoftext|>
"Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an ""angel"" without checking her past, which is terrible!"
<|endoftext|>
"Anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying ""sources said,"" DO NOT believe it. There are no sources, they are just made up lies!"
<|endoftext|>
My condolences to those involved in today's horrible accident in NJ and my deepest gratitude to all of the amazing first responders.
<|endoftext|>
Every on-line poll, Time Magazine, Drudge etc., has me winning the debate. Thank you to Fox &amp, Friends for so reporting!
<|endoftext|>
In the last 24 hrs. we have raised over $13M from online donations and National Call Day, and we’re still going! Thank you America! #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
Well, now they're saying that I not only won the NBC Presidential Forum, but last night the big debate. Nice!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary's been failing for 30 years in not getting the job done - it will never change.
<|endoftext|>
The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon - thank you!
<|endoftext|>
I really enjoyed the debate last night.Crooked Hillary says she is going to do so many things.Why hasn't she done them in her last 30 years?
<|endoftext|>
Nothing on emails. Nothing on the corrupt Clinton Foundation. And nothing on #Benghazi. #Debates2016 #debatenight
<|endoftext|>
My team of deplorables will be managing my Twitter account for this evenings debate. Tune in!#DebateNight #TrumpPence16
<|endoftext|>
"Really sad news: The great Arnold Palmer, the ""King,"" has died. There was no-one like him - a true champion! He will be truly missed."
<|endoftext|>
Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots!
<|endoftext|>
Looking forward to my meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu in Trump Tower at 10:00 A.M.
<|endoftext|>
Bernie Sanders gave Hillary the Dem nomination when he gave up on the e-mails. That issue has only gotten bigger!
<|endoftext|>
Many on the team and staff of Bernie Sanders have been treated badly by the Hillary Clinton campaign - and they like Trump on trade, a lot!
<|endoftext|>
If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary's bad judgement forced her to announce that she would go to Charlotte on Saturday to grandstand. Dem pols said no way, dumb!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton just lost every Republican she ever had, including Never Trump, all farmers &amp, sm. biz, by saying she’ll tax estates at 65%.
<|endoftext|>
Hopefully the violence &amp, unrest in Charlotte will come to an immediate end. To those injured, get well soon. We need unity &amp, leadership.
<|endoftext|>
The situations in Tulsa and Charlotte are tragic. We must come together to make America safe again.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary - see you at the debate!
<|endoftext|>
Heading to North Carolina for two big rallies. Will be there soon. We will bring jobs back where they belong!
<|endoftext|>
Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies - she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning.
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years. Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.
<|endoftext|>
Once again someone we were told is ok turns out to be a terrorist who wants to destroy our country &amp, its people- how did he get thru system?
<|endoftext|>
Great job once again by law enforcement! We are proud of them and should embrace them - without them, we don't have a country!
<|endoftext|>
Terrible attacks in NY, NJ and MN this weekend. Thinking of victims, their families and all Americans! We need to be strong!
<|endoftext|>
Under the leadership of Obama &amp, Clinton, Americans have experienced more attacks at home than victories abroad. Time to change the playbook!
<|endoftext|>
I would like to express my warmest regards, best wishes and condolences to all of the families and victims of the horrible bombing in NYC.
<|endoftext|>
Never met but never liked dopey Robert Gates. Look at the mess the U.S. is in. Always speaks badly of his many bosses, including Obama.
<|endoftext|>
Heading to Colorado for a big rally. Massive crowd, great people! Will be there soon - the polls are looking good.
<|endoftext|>
I never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. He knows nothing about me. But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary wants to take your 2nd Amendment rights away. Will guns be taken from her heavily armed Secret Service detail? Maybe not!
<|endoftext|>
Just leaving Miami for Houston, Oklahoma and Colorado. Miami crowd was fantastic!
<|endoftext|>
I am now going to the brand new Trump International, Hotel D.C. for a major statement.
<|endoftext|>
I was never a fan of Colin Powell after his weak understanding of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq = disaster. We can do much better!
<|endoftext|>
Russia took Crimea during the so-called Obama years. Who wouldn't know this and why does Obama get a free pass?
<|endoftext|>
Why isn't President Obama working instead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton?
<|endoftext|>
Just got back from Asheville,  North Carolina, where we had a massive rally. The spirit of the crowd was unbelievable. Thank you!  #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!
<|endoftext|>
While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!
<|endoftext|>
Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!
<|endoftext|>
Will be in Missouri today with Melania for the funeral of a wonderful and truly respected woman, Phyllis S!
<|endoftext|>
Just returned from Pensacola, Florida, where the crowd was incredible.
<|endoftext|>
It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails &amp, the veteran who said she should be in jail.
<|endoftext|>
With Luis, Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted.
<|endoftext|>
Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Peña Nieto.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media!
<|endoftext|>
"""A rough night for Hillary Clinton""  ABC News."
<|endoftext|>
Wow, reviews are in - THANK YOU!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to our fantastic veterans. The reviews and polls from almost everyone of my Commander-in-Chief presentation were great. Nice!
<|endoftext|>
Mainstream media never covered Hillary’s massive “hacking”or coughing attack, yet it is #1 trending. What’s up?
<|endoftext|>
As a tribute to the late, great Phyllis Schlafly, I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book, THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP.
<|endoftext|>
"China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama ""the son of a whore."" Terrible!"
<|endoftext|>
The truly great Phyllis Schlafly, who honored me with her strong endorsement for president, has passed away at 92. She was very special!
<|endoftext|>
President Obama &amp, Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new? Obama is not a natural deal maker. Only makes bad deals!
<|endoftext|>
"Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the ""C"" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening?"
<|endoftext|>
"To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years, high crime, poor schools, no jobs. I will fix it, VOTE ""T"""
<|endoftext|>
The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?
<|endoftext|>
The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake. Sad!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term!
<|endoftext|>
I visited our Trump Tower campaign headquarters last night, after returning from Ohio and Arizona, and it was packed with great pros - WIN!
<|endoftext|>
People will be very surprised by our ground game on Nov. 8. We have an army of volunteers and people with GREAT SPIRIT! They want to #MAGA!
<|endoftext|>
Poll numbers way up - making big progress!
<|endoftext|>
Great trip to Mexico today  - wonderful leadership and high quality people! Look forward to our next meeting.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton didn't go to Louisiana, and now she didn't go to Mexico. She doesn't have the drive or stamina to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
"Former President Vicente Fox, who is railing against my visit to Mexico today, also invited me when he apologized for using the ""f bomb."""
<|endoftext|>
I have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pena Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow.
<|endoftext|>
From day one I said that I was going to build a great wall on the SOUTHERN BORDER, and much more. Stop illegal immigration. Watch Wednesday!
<|endoftext|>
Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities, they want TRUMP!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or, as stated by Bernie S, she has BAD JUDGEMENT
<|endoftext|>
Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary, who tried so hard, was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D.C. She was forced to go elsewhere
<|endoftext|>
Inner-city crime is reaching record levels. African-Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on!
<|endoftext|>
Look how bad it is getting! How much more crime, how many more shootings, will it take for African-Americans and Latinos to vote Trump=SAFE!
<|endoftext|>
I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona. Big crowds, looking for a larger venue.
<|endoftext|>
I think that both candidates, Crooked Hillary and myself, should release detailed medical records. I have no problem in doing so! Hillary?
<|endoftext|>
Today is the 53rd anniversary of the March on Washington - today we honor the enduring fight for justice, equality and opportunity.
<|endoftext|>
My condolences to Dwyane Wade and his family, on the loss of Nykea Aldridge. They are in my thoughts and prayers.
<|endoftext|>
Dwyane Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!
<|endoftext|>
Heroin overdoses are taking over our children and others in the MIDWEST. Coming in from our southern border. We need strong border &amp, WALL!
<|endoftext|>
Will be in Phoenix, Arizona on Wednesday. Changing venue to much larger one. Demand is unreal. Polls looking great! #ImWithYou
<|endoftext|>
"How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth ""SUPER PREDATORS"" - Has she apologized?"
<|endoftext|>
I am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion. Such a big problem for our country-I will solve
<|endoftext|>
What do African-Americans and Hispanics have to lose by going with me. Look at the poverty, crime and educational statistics. I will fix it!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to solve the problems of poverty, education and safety within the African-American &amp, Hispanic communities
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy, and always very short (stamina). Media gives her a pass!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!
<|endoftext|>
Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!
<|endoftext|>
So many in the African-American community are doing so badly, poverty and crime way up, employment and jobs way down: I will fix it, promise
<|endoftext|>
Thoughts and prayers to the great people of Indiana. You will prevail!
<|endoftext|>
My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families of those affected by two powerful earthquakes in Italy and Myanmar.
<|endoftext|>
President Obama should have gone to Louisiana days ago, instead of golfing. Too little, too late!
<|endoftext|>
"Hillary Clinton strongly stated  that there was ""absolutely no connection"" between her private work and that of The State Department. LIE!"
<|endoftext|>
It is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact,  that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history!
<|endoftext|>
Just leaving Akron, Ohio, after a packed rally. Amazing people! Going now to Texas.
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary is flooding the airwaves with false and misleading ads - all paid for by her bosses on Wall Street. Media is protecting her!
<|endoftext|>
I have been drawing very big and enthusiastic crowds, but the media refuses to show or discuss them. Something very big is happening!
<|endoftext|>
We will bring America together as ONE country again – united as Americans in common purpose and common dreams. #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
Just leaving Virginia - really big crowd, great enthusiasm!
<|endoftext|>
#WheresHillary? Sleeping!!!!!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to everyone for all of the nice comments, by Twitter, pundits and otherwise for my speech last night.
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to NC for last evenings great reception. The speech was a great success. Heading now to Louisiana &amp, another speech tonight in MI.
<|endoftext|>
They will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT!
<|endoftext|>
Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!
<|endoftext|>
"""Stay on message"" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!"
<|endoftext|>
I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
<|endoftext|>
"It is not ""freedom of the press"" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!"
<|endoftext|>
I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
<|endoftext|>
My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
<|endoftext|>
If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%
<|endoftext|>
We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.
<|endoftext|>
I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!
<|endoftext|>
ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State. When will the dishonest media report the facts!
<|endoftext|>
I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!
<|endoftext|>
A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!
<|endoftext|>
Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.
<|endoftext|>
My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers shot in Sebastian County, Arkansas. #LESM
<|endoftext|>
Morning Joe's weakness is its low ratings. I don't watch anymore but I heard he went wild against Rudy Giuliani and #2A - sad &amp, irrelevant!
<|endoftext|>
Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance. I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!
<|endoftext|>
When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed, like Libya, open borders, and maybe her emails?
<|endoftext|>
I am running against the Washington insiders, just like I did in the Republican Primaries. These are the people that have made U.S. a mess!
<|endoftext|>
Being in Detroit today was wonderful. Quick stop in Ohio to meet with some of our great supporters. Just got back home!
<|endoftext|>
Many people are saying that the Iranians killed the scientist who helped the U.S. because of Hillary Clinton's hacked emails.
<|endoftext|>
My economic policy speech will be carried live at 12:15 P.M. Enjoy!
<|endoftext|>
Michael Morell, the lightweight former Acting Director of C.I.A., and a man who has made serious bad calls, is a total Clinton flunky!
<|endoftext|>
"The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, ""the baby"" and so much more. Very dishonest!"
<|endoftext|>
I see where Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore is pushing Crooked hard. Look at the job she has done in Baltimore. She is a joke!
<|endoftext|>
I am not just running against Crooked Hillary Clinton, I am running against the very dishonest and totally biased media - but I will win!
<|endoftext|>
Heading to New Hampshire - will be talking about Hillary saying her brain SHORT CIRCUITED, and other things!
<|endoftext|>
"Anybody whose mind ""SHORT CIRCUITS"" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word ""BRAINWASHED."""
<|endoftext|>
"Crooked Hillary said loudly, and for the world to see, that she ""SHORT CIRCUITED"" when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous!"
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!
<|endoftext|>
The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!
<|endoftext|>
Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS, rise of Iran, and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression!
<|endoftext|>
President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie.
<|endoftext|>
Our incompetent Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was the one who started talks to give 400 million dollars, in cash, to Iran. Scandal!
<|endoftext|>
There is great unity in my campaign, perhaps greater than ever before. I want to thank everyone for your tremendous support. Beat Crooked H!
<|endoftext|>
Great day in Virginia. Crowd was fantastic!
<|endoftext|>
President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!
<|endoftext|>
Vast numbers of manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania have moved to Mexico and other countries. That will end when I win!
<|endoftext|>
When will CNN do a segment on Hillary’s plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays &amp, refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.
<|endoftext|>
People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!
<|endoftext|>
The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.
<|endoftext|>
Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?
<|endoftext|>
When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?
<|endoftext|>
CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs.
<|endoftext|>
CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.
<|endoftext|>
So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!
<|endoftext|>
"When I said in an interview that Putin is ""not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down,"" I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!"
<|endoftext|>
This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!
<|endoftext|>
Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!
<|endoftext|>
The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?
<|endoftext|>
I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!
<|endoftext|>
"Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our ""leaders"" to eradicate it!"
<|endoftext|>
Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.  CLINTON 27.8 MILLION.  Thank you!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.
<|endoftext|>
Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!
<|endoftext|>
"The ""Rust Belt"" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!"
<|endoftext|>
Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP
<|endoftext|>
Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
<|endoftext|>
I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!
<|endoftext|>
"Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two ""Big Thursdays"" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings"
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!
<|endoftext|>
Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.
<|endoftext|>
Just got back from Colorado. The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds!
<|endoftext|>
We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars, NAFTA/TPP support &amp, Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.
<|endoftext|>
Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country.
<|endoftext|>
As usual, Hillary &amp, the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement &amp, insticts.
<|endoftext|>
I am watching Crooked Hillary speak. Same old stuff, our country needs change!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V.P. pick!
<|endoftext|>
The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech. He wishes he didn't make that deal!
<|endoftext|>
"Crooked Hillary said that I ""couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign."" Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!"
<|endoftext|>
If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town!  #NeverHillary
<|endoftext|>
"""Little"" Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!"
<|endoftext|>
General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD  #NeverHillary
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!
<|endoftext|>
Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER!
<|endoftext|>
"Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and ""forgot"" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!"
<|endoftext|>
No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!
<|endoftext|>
Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.
<|endoftext|>
Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office. It will only go further down under Clinton.
<|endoftext|>
A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees.
<|endoftext|>
President Obama spoke last night about a world that doesn’t exist. 70% of the people think our country is going in the wrong direction. #DNC
<|endoftext|>
Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair.
<|endoftext|>
Shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year. We must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers!
<|endoftext|>
If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!
<|endoftext|>
Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
<|endoftext|>
"Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to ""carpet bomb"" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!"
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
<|endoftext|>
Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
<|endoftext|>
The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
<|endoftext|>
As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.
<|endoftext|>
Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?
<|endoftext|>
I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!
<|endoftext|>
No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!
<|endoftext|>
For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.
<|endoftext|>
In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!
<|endoftext|>
Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS &amp, her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
<|endoftext|>
Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!
<|endoftext|>
The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!
<|endoftext|>
Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.
<|endoftext|>
Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great
<|endoftext|>
Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.
<|endoftext|>
Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!
<|endoftext|>
Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
<|endoftext|>
If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.
<|endoftext|>
Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!
<|endoftext|>
While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
<|endoftext|>
Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.
<|endoftext|>
Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
<|endoftext|>
Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!
<|endoftext|>
"Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her ""servant"" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie."
<|endoftext|>
If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
<|endoftext|>
How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!
<|endoftext|>
The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me
<|endoftext|>
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS &amp, all others laughing!
<|endoftext|>
The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!
<|endoftext|>
The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp, well!
<|endoftext|>
Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out
<|endoftext|>
If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild
<|endoftext|>
I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
<|endoftext|>
Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!
<|endoftext|>
"There is no longer a Bernie Sanders ""political revolution."" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!"
<|endoftext|>
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
<|endoftext|>
Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
<|endoftext|>
Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT
<|endoftext|>
The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!
<|endoftext|>
The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!
<|endoftext|>
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
<|endoftext|>
I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
<|endoftext|>
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
<|endoftext|>
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
<|endoftext|>
Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED
<|endoftext|>
Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!
<|endoftext|>
Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!
<|endoftext|>
The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?
<|endoftext|>
I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
<|endoftext|>
Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?
<|endoftext|>
Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.
<|endoftext|>
Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!
<|endoftext|>
What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all. The police and Secret Service were fantastic!
<|endoftext|>
Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is VERY united. Great love in the arena!
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz talks about the Constitution but doesn't say that if the Dems win the Presidency, the new JUSTICES appointed will destroy us all!
<|endoftext|>
I am soooo proud of my children, Don, Eric and Tiffany - their speeches, under enormous pressure, were incredible. Ivanka intros me tonight!
<|endoftext|>
Arena was packed, totally electric!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal!
<|endoftext|>
John Kasich was never asked by me to be V.P. Just arrived in Cleveland - will be a great two days!
<|endoftext|>
The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.
<|endoftext|>
Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!
<|endoftext|>
In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!
<|endoftext|>
Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST!
<|endoftext|>
The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention. Very exciting!
<|endoftext|>
It was truly an honor to introduce my wife, Melania. Her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible. Very proud! #GOPConvention
<|endoftext|>
Looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife, Melania. Place looks beautiful!
<|endoftext|>
President Obama just had a news conference, but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse!
<|endoftext|>
Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. We are not looking good, we are not looking smart, we are not looking tough!
<|endoftext|>
We are TRYING to fight ISIS, and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching
<|endoftext|>
If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H
<|endoftext|>
I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!
<|endoftext|>
It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!
<|endoftext|>
As the days and weeks go by,  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!
<|endoftext|>
We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again!
<|endoftext|>
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con it's over
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to Jack Morgan, Tamara Neo, Cheryl Ann Kraft and all of my friends and supporters in Virginia. GREAT JOB!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to Chris Cox and Bikers for Trump - Your support has been amazing. I will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street, lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!
<|endoftext|>
Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, Crooked Hillary Clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have done
<|endoftext|>
Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana). My first choice from start!
<|endoftext|>
Look forward to Governor Mike Pence V.P. introduction tomorrow in New York City.
<|endoftext|>
I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate. News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A.M.
<|endoftext|>
Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable. Look what has happened to the world with O &amp, Hillary!
<|endoftext|>
#NeverTrump is never more. They were crushed last night in Cleveland at Rules Committee by a vote of 87-12. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice, France. We are with you in every way!
<|endoftext|>
In light of the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement.
<|endoftext|>
Another horrific attack, this time in Nice, France. Many dead and injured. When will we learn? It is only getting worse.
<|endoftext|>
I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Crooked Hillary will sell us out, just like her husband did with NAFTA.
<|endoftext|>
I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow.
<|endoftext|>
If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!
<|endoftext|>
Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!
<|endoftext|>
On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.
<|endoftext|>
Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.
<|endoftext|>
Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!
<|endoftext|>
The Republican platform is most pro-Israel of all time!
<|endoftext|>
New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall. We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign!
<|endoftext|>
To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals &amp, global special interests, we welcome you with open arms. People first.
<|endoftext|>
Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.
<|endoftext|>
Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.
<|endoftext|>
I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!
<|endoftext|>
Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!
<|endoftext|>
This election is a choice between law, order &amp, safety - or chaos, crime &amp, violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou
<|endoftext|>
For too many years, our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need.
<|endoftext|>
Crime is out of control, and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities. Not good!
<|endoftext|>
Thoughts and prayers with the victims, and their families- along with everyone at the Berrien County Courthouse in St. Joseph, Michigan.
<|endoftext|>
The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!
<|endoftext|>
President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!
<|endoftext|>
Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!
<|endoftext|>
Due to the horrific events taking place in our country, I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami.
<|endoftext|>
Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country
<|endoftext|>
After today, Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin' Crooked Hillary.
<|endoftext|>
Just leaving D.C. Had great meetings with Republicans in the House and Senate. Very interesting day! These are people who love our country!
<|endoftext|>
Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live.
<|endoftext|>
Great Concert at 4:00 P.M. today at Lincoln Memorial. Enjoy!
<|endoftext|>
Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.
<|endoftext|>
Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City
<|endoftext|>
I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.
<|endoftext|>
"Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team ""were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information."" Not fit!"
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
<|endoftext|>
"I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with ""murder."" Come November 8, she's out!"
<|endoftext|>
Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win
<|endoftext|>
FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem
<|endoftext|>
The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment.
<|endoftext|>
Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!
<|endoftext|>
Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
<|endoftext|>
With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!
<|endoftext|>
"Crooked Hillary Clinton is ""guilty as hell"" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?"
<|endoftext|>
The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!
<|endoftext|>
Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people!
<|endoftext|>
Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid!
<|endoftext|>
Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!
<|endoftext|>
The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!
<|endoftext|>
In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!
<|endoftext|>
I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
<|endoftext|>
"The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting ""go away, no pictures."""
<|endoftext|>
"Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about ""grandkids"" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?"
<|endoftext|>
"""THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"""
<|endoftext|>
On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged &amp, corrupt!
<|endoftext|>
Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
<|endoftext|>
It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!
<|endoftext|>
It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!
<|endoftext|>
The speakers slots at the Republican Convention are totally filled, with a long waiting list of those that want to speak - Wednesday release
<|endoftext|>
Just returned from Colorado. Amazing crowd!
<|endoftext|>
Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
<|endoftext|>
Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
<|endoftext|>
As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!
<|endoftext|>
The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!
<|endoftext|>
Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine. Thank you to everyone for making it so special!
<|endoftext|>
ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!
<|endoftext|>
Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?
<|endoftext|>
Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!
<|endoftext|>
We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.
<|endoftext|>
Yet another terrorist attack, this time in Turkey. Willthe world ever realize what is going on? So sad.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton’s Presidency would be catastrophic forthe future of our country. She is ill-fit with bad judgment.
<|endoftext|>
Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure. It justnever seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton.
<|endoftext|>
The media is unrelenting. They will only go with and report a story in a negative light. I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong), watch November
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate, goofy Elizabeth Warren, who lied on heritage.
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong. I said LEAVE will win. She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. Only a question of time
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton is not a change agent, just the same old status quo! She is spending a fortune, I am spending very little. Close in polls!
<|endoftext|>
People in our country want borders, and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win. It is time for CHANGE -- and JOBS!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot, but I never did = lie! Was there to support son
<|endoftext|>
Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton, who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama), is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call.
<|endoftext|>
George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls
<|endoftext|>
Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son, Eric, did a great job - under budget!
<|endoftext|>
Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!
<|endoftext|>
I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!
<|endoftext|>
We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #AmericaFirst
<|endoftext|>
We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.
<|endoftext|>
So funny, Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly, and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U.K. All talk, no action!
<|endoftext|>
Thoughts and prayers are with everyone in West Virginia- dealing with the devastating floods. #ImWithYou
<|endoftext|>
Many people are equating BREXIT, and what is going on in Great Britain, with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back!
<|endoftext|>
The opening of Trump Turnberry in Scotland was a big success. Good timing, I was here for BREXIT. Very exciting news conference today!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT - she went with Obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead. She would be a disaster
<|endoftext|>
America is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder w/a free &amp, ind UK. We stand together as friends, as allies, &amp, as a people w/a shared history.
<|endoftext|>
Self-determination is the sacred right of all free people's, and the people of the UK have exercised that right for all the world to see.
<|endoftext|>
Getting ready to open the magnificent Turnberry in Scotland. What a great day, especially when added to the brave &amp, brilliant vote.
<|endoftext|>
Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games!
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations to my son, Eric, on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding Turnberry, and its great Ailsa Course. Always support kids!
<|endoftext|>
Leaving now for a one night trip to Scotland in order to be at the Grand Opening of my great Turnberry Resort. Will be back on Sat. night!
<|endoftext|>
Our inner cities have been left behind. We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border.
<|endoftext|>
On immigration, I’m consulting with our immigration officers&amp, our wage-earners. Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street.
<|endoftext|>
Obama &amp, Clinton should stop meeting with special interests, &amp, start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton’s open borders are tearing American families apart. I am going to make our country Safe Again for all Americans. #Imwithyou
<|endoftext|>
SC has kept us safe from exec amnesty--for now. But Hillary has pledged to expand it, taking jobs from Hispanic &amp, African-American workers.
<|endoftext|>
"ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama.""  --  Donald J. Trump"
<|endoftext|>
"""Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.""  --   Donald J. Trump"
<|endoftext|>
"Thank you to Donald Rumsfeld for the endorsement. Very much appreciated. Clinton's conduct has been ""disqualifying."""
<|endoftext|>
Hillary says things can't change. I say they have to change. It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism. #Imwithyou
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest.
<|endoftext|>
If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty &amp, judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.
<|endoftext|>
"I am ""the king of debt.""That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S."
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.
<|endoftext|>
How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% asSecretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary says this election is about judgment.  She's right.  Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.
<|endoftext|>
I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess!
<|endoftext|>
When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees
<|endoftext|>
How can the NY Times show an empty room hours before my speech even started when they knew it was going to be packed? So totally dishonest!
<|endoftext|>
In Las Vegas, getting ready to speak!
<|endoftext|>
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
People very unhappy with Crooked Hillary and Obama on JOBS and SAFETY! Biggest trade deficit in many years! More attacks will follow Orlando
<|endoftext|>
Amazing crowd last night in Dallas - more spirit and passion than ever before. Today, all over the great State of Texas!
<|endoftext|>
I will be meeting with the NRA, who has endorsed me, about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no fly list, to buy guns.
<|endoftext|>
The press is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart message directly to the people!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.
<|endoftext|>
AMERICA FIRST!
<|endoftext|>
American must now get very tough, very smart and very vigilant. We cannot admit people into our country without extraordinary screening.
<|endoftext|>
In my speech on protecting America I spoke about a temporary ban, which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to Islamic terror.
<|endoftext|>
I will be going to New Hampshire today, home of my first primary victory, to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday. 2:30 P.M.
<|endoftext|>
I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use!
<|endoftext|>
What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough
<|endoftext|>
"Reporting that Orlando killer shouted ""Allah hu Akbar!"" as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade."
<|endoftext|>
Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!
<|endoftext|>
Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness &amp, vigilance. We must be smart!
<|endoftext|>
Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims &amp, their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart &amp, vigilant?
<|endoftext|>
Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!
<|endoftext|>
Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.
<|endoftext|>
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career. Very racist!
<|endoftext|>
Don King, and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me, would not have done so if they thought I was a racist!
<|endoftext|>
Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is
<|endoftext|>
Heading to D.C. to speak at Faith and Freedom Coalition and visit OPO.
<|endoftext|>
The great boxing promoter, Don King, just endorsed me. Nice!
<|endoftext|>
Pocahontas is at it again! Goofy Elizabeth Warren, one of the least productive U.S. Senators, has a nasty mouth. Hope she is V.P. choice.
<|endoftext|>
Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obama—but nobody else does!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton will be a disaster on jobs, the economy, trade, healthcare, the military, guns and just about all else. Obama plus!
<|endoftext|>
As expected, the media is very much against me. Their dishonesty is amazing but, just like our big wins in the primaries, we will win!
<|endoftext|>
Bernie Sanders must really dislike Crooked Hillary after the way she played him. Many of his supporters, because of trade, will come to me.
<|endoftext|>
I would have had many millions of votes more than Crooked Hillary Clinton except for the fact that I had 16 opponents, she had one!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to all for your wonderful comments on my speech. I could feel the electricity in thr air. Great reviews - most votes ever recieved
<|endoftext|>
I will be speaking about our great journey to the Republican nomination at 9:00 P.M. The movement toward a country that WINS again continues
<|endoftext|>
In just out book, Secret Service Agent Gary Byrne doesn't believe that Crooked Hillary has the temperament or integrity to be the president!
<|endoftext|>
A former Secret Service Agent for President Clinton excoriates Crooked Hillary describing her as ERRATIC &amp, VIOLENT. Bad temperament for pres
<|endoftext|>
I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff. But small is good, flexible, save money and number one!
<|endoftext|>
A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38,000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. That's REALLY bad!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!
<|endoftext|>
Just like I have been able to spend far less money than  others on the campaign and finish #1, so too should our country. We can be great!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change!
<|endoftext|>
We just had the worst jobs report since 2010.
<|endoftext|>
The Mayor of San Jose did a terrible job of ordering the  protection of innocent people. The thugs were lucky supporters remained peaceful!
<|endoftext|>
Many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals. They burned the American flag and laughed at police
<|endoftext|>
Muhammad Ali is dead at 74! A truly great champion and a wonderful guy. He will be missed by all!
<|endoftext|>
Great evening in San Jose other than the thugs. My supporters are far tougher if they want to be, but fortunately they are not hostile.
<|endoftext|>
In Crooked Hillary's telepromter speech yesterday, she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest!
<|endoftext|>
Rally last night in San Jose was great. Tremendous love and enthusiasm in the hall. Big crowd. Outside, small group of thugs burned Am flag!
<|endoftext|>
Terrible jobs report just reported. Only 38,000 jobs added. Bombshell!
<|endoftext|>
Then, on June 25th- back to the USA to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
A 60% increase in Texas Blue Cross/Blue Shield through ObamaCare. I told you so, there is panic and anger as healthcare costs explode!
<|endoftext|>
So great to have the endorsement and support of Paul Ryan. We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again!
<|endoftext|>
Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. People will not allow another four years of incompetence!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions.
<|endoftext|>
After the litigation is disposed of and the case won, I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?), so much interest in it! I will be pres.
<|endoftext|>
Even though I have a very biased and unfair judge in the Trump U civil case in San Diego, I have thousands of great reviews &amp, will win case!
<|endoftext|>
With all of the Crooked Hillary Clinton's foreign policy experience, she has made so many mistakes - and I mean real monsters! No more HRC.
<|endoftext|>
Wow, USA Today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits. Verdict: 450 wins, 38 losses. Isn't that what you want for your president?
<|endoftext|>
Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent - she should not be president. Her temperament is bad and her decision making ability-zilch!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of e-mails. Many missing!
<|endoftext|>
So I raised/gave $5,600,000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! They do anything to belittle - totally biased.
<|endoftext|>
I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.
<|endoftext|>
Katie Couric, the third rate reporter, who has been largely forgotten, should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc.
<|endoftext|>
So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.
<|endoftext|>
Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5,600,000 that I raised/gave!
<|endoftext|>
I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!
<|endoftext|>
So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A.M. today, Trump Tower!
<|endoftext|>
I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who is totally biased against me.
<|endoftext|>
I have a judge in the Trump University civil case, Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego), who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump
<|endoftext|>
I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!
<|endoftext|>
I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent, instead of sixteen. Broke record
<|endoftext|>
Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
The endorsement of me by the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!
<|endoftext|>
In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!
<|endoftext|>
Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.
<|endoftext|>
If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent, say good bye to the Supreme Court!
<|endoftext|>
The Republican Party has to be smart &amp, strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!
<|endoftext|>
Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if the GOP can't control their own, then they are not a party. Be tough, R's!
<|endoftext|>
Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.
<|endoftext|>
Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit!
<|endoftext|>
Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.
<|endoftext|>
Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW
<|endoftext|>
Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!
<|endoftext|>
The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money &amp, get much better results! What we need as Prez!
<|endoftext|>
I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.
<|endoftext|>
The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice, but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH
<|endoftext|>
I find it offensive that Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be Native American to get in Harvard.
<|endoftext|>
The Inspector General's report on Crooked Hillary Clinton is a disaster. Such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the W.H.
<|endoftext|>
Thank you Washington! Honored to say, on behalf of our great movement, we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history.
<|endoftext|>
The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have it
<|endoftext|>
Great rally in New Mexico, amazing crowd! Now in L.A. Big rally in Anaheim.
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement!
<|endoftext|>
I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!
<|endoftext|>
Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.
<|endoftext|>
Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.
<|endoftext|>
While under no obligation to do so, I have raised between 5 &amp, 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our VETERANS. Nice!
<|endoftext|>
Obama’s VA Secretary just said we shouldn't measurewait times. Hillary says VA problems are not ‘widespread.’ I will take care ofour vets!
<|endoftext|>
In trade, military and EVERYTHING else, it will be AMERICA FIRST! This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists!
<|endoftext|>
Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race - e-mail scandal!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We can’t allow this. Time to get smart and protect America!
<|endoftext|>
How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam, which horribly oppresses women?
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary said that I  want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria, Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!
<|endoftext|>
While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the TSA is falling apart, just like our government! Airports a total disaster!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary. Four more years of this? No way!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!
<|endoftext|>
Look where the world is today, a total mess, and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast, Hillary has no chance!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS, China, Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!
<|endoftext|>
"I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is ""not qualified"" to be president because she has ""very bad judgement"" - Bernie said the same thing!"
<|endoftext|>
Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough, smart and vigilant? Great hate and sickness!
<|endoftext|>
My list of potential U.S. Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved. During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list!
<|endoftext|>
Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats - the system is rigged against him. Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me!
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations to THE MOVEMENT, we have just won THE GREAT STATE OF OREGON. The vote percentage is even higher than anticipated! Thank you.
<|endoftext|>
I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton! Democrat Primaries are rigged, e-mail investigation is rigged - so time to get it on!
<|endoftext|>
"Well, that is it. Well done Megyn --- and they all lived happily ever after! Now let us all see how ""THE MOVEMENT"" does in Oregon tonight!"
<|endoftext|>
Will go back on for a final question now!
<|endoftext|>
I like Michael Douglas!
<|endoftext|>
Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud, just like Crooked Hillary! Their main line had nothing to do with women, and they knew it. Apologize?
<|endoftext|>
Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal? If she can't win Kentucky, she should drop out of race. System rigged!
<|endoftext|>
How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA, the worst economic deal in U.S. history?
<|endoftext|>
"Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.If so, he should run,not her.Will he bring the ""energizer"" to D.C.?"
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!
<|endoftext|>
Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history
<|endoftext|>
Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China
<|endoftext|>
"The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. ""You can tell them to go BLANK themselves"" - was about China, NOT WOMEN!"
<|endoftext|>
Wow, 30,000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?
<|endoftext|>
What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back. I said no.
<|endoftext|>
I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job, when that was unheard of, and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you!
<|endoftext|>
"""In politics, and in life, ignorance is not a virtue."" This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history!"
<|endoftext|>
Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie, run.
<|endoftext|>
The media is really on a witch-hunt against me. False reporting, and plenty of it - but we will prevail!
<|endoftext|>
If Crooked Hillary Clinton can't close the deal on Crazy Bernie, how is she going to take on China, Russia, ISIS and all of the others?
<|endoftext|>
Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday, very much to my surprise, and we had a very interesting talk about national security, and more!
<|endoftext|>
If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren, we’d have no jobs in America—she doesn’t have a clue.
<|endoftext|>
Isn’t it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump &amp, gets nothing done in Senate?
<|endoftext|>
Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See media—asking for increase!
<|endoftext|>
Our Native American Senator, goofy Elizabeth Warren, couldn’t care less about the American worker...does nothing to help!
<|endoftext|>
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman’s card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet “when a woman stands up to you...”
<|endoftext|>
If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been, she would lose!
<|endoftext|>
Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn’t have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.
<|endoftext|>
Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!
<|endoftext|>
I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come!
<|endoftext|>
Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska. Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary, who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie, will lose!
<|endoftext|>
The Clintons spend millions on negative ads on me &amp, I can’t tell the truth about her husband? Don’t feel sorry for crooked Hillary!
<|endoftext|>
It was so great being in Nebraska last week. Today is the big day--get out and vote!
<|endoftext|>
I look very much forward to meeting w/Paul Ryan &amp, the GOP Party Leadership on Thurs in DC. Together, we will beat the Dems at all levels!
<|endoftext|>
It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.
<|endoftext|>
Why does the media, with a strong push from Crooked Hillary, keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite!
<|endoftext|>
Get out and vote Nebraska, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Get out and vote West Virginia, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!
<|endoftext|>
I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people!
<|endoftext|>
If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton, I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beat—she had one!
<|endoftext|>
I will win the election against Crooked Hillary despite the people in the Republican Party that are currently and selfishly opposed to me!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary just can't close the deal with Bernie. It will be the same way with ISIS, and China on trade, and Mexico at the border. Bad!
<|endoftext|>
I will be interviewed on This Week with George S this morning. Enjoy!
<|endoftext|>
Remember when the two failed presidential candidates, Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush, signed a binding PLEDGE? They broke the deal, no honor!
<|endoftext|>
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name?
<|endoftext|>
Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
<|endoftext|>
Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy.
<|endoftext|>
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.
<|endoftext|>
Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud!
<|endoftext|>
I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.
<|endoftext|>
Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!
<|endoftext|>
Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters!
<|endoftext|>
So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
"Governor Rick Perry said ""Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen."" Thank you Rick!"
<|endoftext|>
Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton, who wants to destroy all miners, I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016
<|endoftext|>
"Can you believe Crooked Hillary said, ""We are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&amp,coal companies out of business."" She then apologized."
<|endoftext|>
Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates &amp, otherwise. He should show them, &amp, run as an Independent.
<|endoftext|>
Many reports that I will be attending the Alvarez/Khan fight this weekend in Vegas. Totally untrue! Unfortunately I have other plans.
<|endoftext|>
I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie!
<|endoftext|>
What a great evening we had. So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary. The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you Indiana, we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special people-I will never forget!
<|endoftext|>
Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will, and must, win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time &amp, money
<|endoftext|>
Wow, Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!
<|endoftext|>
Will be in South Bend, Indiana in a short while -- big rally! See you soon!
<|endoftext|>
I will be campaigning in Indiana all day. Things are looking great, and the support of Bobby Knight has been so amazing. Today will be fun!
<|endoftext|>
Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags. I want America First - so do voters!
<|endoftext|>
Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs, and he thanks me! I will bring back jobs to USA.
<|endoftext|>
"Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to ""dealing with men who get off the reservation."" Actually, she has done poorly with such men!"
<|endoftext|>
Will be in Terre Haute, Indiana in a short while -- big rally! See you soon!
<|endoftext|>
I will be in Indiana on Sunday and Monday at four MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN rallies. See you there!
<|endoftext|>
The economy is bad and getting worse-almost ZERO growth this quarter. Nobody can beat me on the economy (and jobs). MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
<|endoftext|>
"The ""protesters"" in California were thugs and criminals. Many are professionals. They should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement!"
<|endoftext|>
We are now at 1001 delegates. We will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency, is also one of the all time great enablers!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up. What a dumb deal - dead on arrival!
<|endoftext|>
So many false and phony T.V. commercials being broadcast in Indiana. Reminds me of Florida where thousands were put up-I won in a landslide!
<|endoftext|>
I will be in Evansville, Indiana, with the great Bobby Knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon. See you there!
<|endoftext|>
Lyin' Ted Cruz, who can never beat Hillary Clinton and has NO path to victory, has chosen a V.P.candidate who failed badly in her own effort
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech. I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics!
<|endoftext|>
Getting the strong endorsement of the great coach, Bobby Knight, has been a highlight of my stay in Indiana. Big speech tomorrow with Bobby!
<|endoftext|>
I am in Indiana where we just had a great rally. Fantastic people! Staying at a Holiday Inn Express - new and clean, not bad!
<|endoftext|>
How bad is the New York Times—the most inaccurate coverage constantly. Always trying to belittle. Paper has lost its way!
<|endoftext|>
Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates &amp, otherwise. He should show them, and run as an Independent!
<|endoftext|>
The Cruz-Kasich pact is under great strain. This joke of a deal is falling apart, not being honored and almost dead. Very dumb!
<|endoftext|>
On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!
<|endoftext|>
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.
<|endoftext|>
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
<|endoftext|>
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
<|endoftext|>
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors &amp, special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!
<|endoftext|>
I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday!
<|endoftext|>
As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads, he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win!
<|endoftext|>
I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!
<|endoftext|>
Will be spending the day campaigning in Connecticut, another state where jobs are being stolen by other countries. I will stop this fast!
<|endoftext|>
I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed!
<|endoftext|>
Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.
<|endoftext|>
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
<|endoftext|>
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!
<|endoftext|>
We are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to Indiana!
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you New York, I will never forget!
<|endoftext|>
A big day for New York and for our COUNTRY! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Lyin’ Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York!
<|endoftext|>
Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him
<|endoftext|>
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him &amp, K
<|endoftext|>
I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!
<|endoftext|>
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!
<|endoftext|>
Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.
<|endoftext|>
I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning, Staten Island. Big crowd, will be fun!
<|endoftext|>
Big protest march in Colorado on Friday afternoon! Don't let the bosses take your vote!
<|endoftext|>
The rules DID CHANGE in Colorado shortly after I entered the race in June because the pols and their bosses knew I would win with the voters
<|endoftext|>
Biggest story in politics is now happening in the great State of Colorado where over one million people have been precluded from voting!
<|endoftext|>
Leaving for Albany, New York now, massive crowd expected. Very exciting!
<|endoftext|>
The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!
<|endoftext|>
How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger - totally unfair!
<|endoftext|>
I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!
<|endoftext|>
Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president. Based on her decision making ability, I can go along with that!
<|endoftext|>
Isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else, me, still must fight
<|endoftext|>
So great to be in New York. Catching up on many things (remember, I am still running a major business while I campaign) and loving it!
<|endoftext|>
Unbelievable evening. Just made a speech in front 17,000 amazing New Yorkers in Bethpage, Long Island--- great to be home!
<|endoftext|>
It is so great to be back home! Looking forward to a great rally tonight in Bethpage, Long Island!
<|endoftext|>
Wisconsin, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
A great day in Wisconsin, many stops, many great people! Melania is joining me on Monday. Big crowds. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade, but if I win, all of the bad things happening in the U.S. will be rapidly reversed!
<|endoftext|>
I will be in Wisconsin until the election. Jobs, trade and immigration will be big factors. I will bring jobs back home - make great deals!
<|endoftext|>
Can you believe that Ted Cruz, who has been killing our country on trade for so long, just put out a Wisconsin ad talking about trade?
<|endoftext|>
For the 1st time in American history, America’s 16,500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsement—me! Thank you.
<|endoftext|>
The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) said that our open border is the biggest physical &amp, economic threat facing the American people!
<|endoftext|>
The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates. Try again!
<|endoftext|>
The Club For Growth,which asked me for $1,000,000 in an extortion attempt, just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group!
<|endoftext|>
Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape?
<|endoftext|>
Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!
<|endoftext|>
I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.
<|endoftext|>
We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN &amp, MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Lyin' Ted, I have already beaten you in all debates, and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs &amp, illegal imm!
<|endoftext|>
Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak &amp, losing big, so now he wants to debate again. But, according to Drudge,Time and on-line polls, I have won all debates
<|endoftext|>
After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb, Rand, Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries, no way he would ever endorse me!
<|endoftext|>
Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President!
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism, as well as current mission, but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE, a must!
<|endoftext|>
"A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called ""leaders"" ever learn!"
<|endoftext|>
The United States cannot continue to make such bad, one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more!
<|endoftext|>
Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be, I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming
<|endoftext|>
Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great!  JOBS!
<|endoftext|>
Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women &amp, children. At least 67 dead,400 injured. I alone can solve
<|endoftext|>
Happy Easter to all, have a great day!
<|endoftext|>
My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now, finally, receiving plaudits!
<|endoftext|>
Remember, I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters, I am not bought like others!
<|endoftext|>
Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S., jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs
<|endoftext|>
Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!
<|endoftext|>
Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!
<|endoftext|>
The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite!
<|endoftext|>
The media is so after me on women  Wow, this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!
<|endoftext|>
Top suspect in Paris massacre, Salah Abdeslam, who also knew of the Brussels attack, is no longer talking. Weak leaders, ridiculous laws!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot?
<|endoftext|>
I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania, he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence, Lyin' Ted!
<|endoftext|>
Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story!
<|endoftext|>
Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad!
<|endoftext|>
Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also, many in U.S.  I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE, I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST!
<|endoftext|>
It is amazing how often I am right, only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration, take the oil, build the wall, Muslims, NATO!
<|endoftext|>
These politicians like Cruz and Graham, who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years, do nothing to make things better!
<|endoftext|>
We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate, and the time is now!
<|endoftext|>
N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!
<|endoftext|>
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!
<|endoftext|>
I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!
<|endoftext|>
I will be the best by far in fighting terror. I’m the only one that was right from the beginning, &amp, now Lyin’ Ted &amp, others are copying me.
<|endoftext|>
Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. She’s been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!
<|endoftext|>
Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyin’ Ted Cruz. Honestly, I can’t blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!
<|endoftext|>
Lyin’ Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglas— just another dishonest politician.
<|endoftext|>
Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!
<|endoftext|>
Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!
<|endoftext|>
Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you, I will never forget!
<|endoftext|>
Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way!
<|endoftext|>
Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!
<|endoftext|>
Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately &amp, get home to Washington- where a #POTUS, under a serious emergency belongs!
<|endoftext|>
Obama, and all others, have been so weak, and so politically correct, that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame.
<|endoftext|>
My heart &amp, prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible #Brussels tragedy. This madness must be stopped, and I will stop it.
<|endoftext|>
I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and it’s not even close. Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today!
<|endoftext|>
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba, especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly!
<|endoftext|>
Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore, it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, President Obama just landed in Cuba, a big deal, and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect
<|endoftext|>
Big Republican Dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. I will be there!
<|endoftext|>
The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday, delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours, and the media blames my supporters!
<|endoftext|>
Why is it that the horrendous protesters, who scream, curse punch, shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES,  are never blamed by media? SAD!
<|endoftext|>
The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great! Tremendous crowds and spirit. Just returned but will be going back soon.
<|endoftext|>
Heading to Phoneix. Will be arriving soon. Tomorrow a big day. Tremendous crowds expected! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
<|endoftext|>
Just leaving Salt Lake City, Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions. Love Utah- will be back!
<|endoftext|>
Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet? Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri?
<|endoftext|>
Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets!
<|endoftext|>
Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost!
<|endoftext|>
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich &amp, Marco Rubio, and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2
<|endoftext|>
"Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who ""choked"" and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!"
<|endoftext|>
Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary
<|endoftext|>
Club For Growth tried to extort $1,000,000 from me. When I said NO, they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful!
<|endoftext|>
With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?
<|endoftext|>
Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!
<|endoftext|>
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine!
<|endoftext|>
The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem!
<|endoftext|>
Stuart Stevens, the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss, is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, just won Missouri!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to the Governor of Florida, Rick Scott, for your endorsement. I greatly appreciate your support!
<|endoftext|>
In the last 2 weeks, I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida &amp, I won in a massive landslide.The establishment should save their $$!
<|endoftext|>
Yesterday was amazing—5 victories.  Lyin’ Ted Cruzhad zero. Things are going very well!
<|endoftext|>
I only wish my wonderful daughter Tiffany could have been with us at Mar-a-Lago for our great election victory. She is a winner!
<|endoftext|>
Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore. Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. With two people, big &amp, over!
<|endoftext|>
Word is that, despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads, I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon!
<|endoftext|>
A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false.
<|endoftext|>
"I will bring our jobs back to the U.S., and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will ""sing"" again."
<|endoftext|>
In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary!
<|endoftext|>
Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!
<|endoftext|>
Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down.
<|endoftext|>
North Carolina lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400,000 since 2000. Going to Mexico etc. NO MORE IF I WIN, WE WILL BRING BACK!
<|endoftext|>
Just in, big news- I have been declared the winner of the CNMI Rep Caucus with 72.8% of the vote! Thank you! #SuperTuesday #VoteTrump
<|endoftext|>
Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc.).
<|endoftext|>
Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!
<|endoftext|>
I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL
<|endoftext|>
Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness!
<|endoftext|>
Kasich has helped decimate the coal and steel industries in Ohio. I will bring them back! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
<|endoftext|>
Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA, which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers!
<|endoftext|>
Leaving the great people of North Carolina. Amazing event. Heading to Tampa now! #VoteTrump
<|endoftext|>
Look forward to being in Tampa this afternoon. Wonderful crowds. Thank you, Florida!
<|endoftext|>
Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- &amp, should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.
<|endoftext|>
Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA, from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP, which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying!
<|endoftext|>
Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania, not enough signatures. Big problem!
<|endoftext|>
Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words, education of your children from D.C. No way
<|endoftext|>
It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!
<|endoftext|>
The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump --- and that is fact!
<|endoftext|>
We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio. No way to run a country!
<|endoftext|>
Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco, his State Chairman, &amp, their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote.
<|endoftext|>
The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
<|endoftext|>
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
On my way to Dayton, Ohio. Will be there soon!
<|endoftext|>
The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio!
<|endoftext|>
Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil, they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud!
<|endoftext|>
Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico!
<|endoftext|>
The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America!
<|endoftext|>
I just got off the phone with the great people of Guam! Thank you for your support! #VoteTrump today! #Trump2016
<|endoftext|>
Phony Club For Growth tried to shake me down for one million dollars, &amp, is now putting out nasty negative ads on me. They are total losers!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you Hawaii! #Trump2016
<|endoftext|>
This was a great evening- I would like to thank everyone for their wonderful support.
<|endoftext|>
Thank you Michigan! #Trump2016
<|endoftext|>
Thank you Mississippi! #Trump2016
<|endoftext|>
Word is I am doing very well in Michigan and Mississippi! Wow, and with all that money spent against me! Will be going to Trump Jupiter now!
<|endoftext|>
The negative television commercials about me, paid for by the politicians bosses, are a total #Mediafraud. When you watch, remember!
<|endoftext|>
Mitt Romney had his chance and blew it. Lindsey Graham ran for president, got ZERO, and quit! Why are they now spokesmen against me? Sad!
<|endoftext|>
Remember, I am the only one who is self-funding my campaign. All of the other candidates are bought and paid for by special interests!
<|endoftext|>
Sun Sentinel says: Rubio lacks the experience, work ethic and gravitas needed to be president. HE HAS NOT EARNED YOUR VOTE!
<|endoftext|>
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
I employ many people in Hawaii at my great hotel in Honolulu. I’ll be there very soon. Vote for me, Hawaii!
<|endoftext|>
Cruz came to Mississippi, there was nobody there, he left the state. I had a rally in Madison, MS with 10,000! Thank you!
<|endoftext|>
It was great being in Michigan. Remember, I am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the U.S.and protect car industry!
<|endoftext|>
Don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight Rubio and the R establishment. Dishonest people!
<|endoftext|>
Leaving for North Carolina. Big crowd, will be fun!
<|endoftext|>
Congratulation to Adam Scott and all of the folks at Trump National Doral on producing a really great WGC Tournament. Amazing finish!
<|endoftext|>
I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate, he is scamming Florida
<|endoftext|>
We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, who could not stop Obama (twice), ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of  $'s in false ads!
<|endoftext|>
Lindsey Graham is all over T.V., much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney. These nasty, angry, jealous  failures have ZERO credibility!
<|endoftext|>
Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me. I destroyed his run, brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out. Now nasty!
<|endoftext|>
How do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians? I will be using Facebook &amp, Twitter. Watch!
<|endoftext|>
All of the phony T.V. commercials against me are bought and payed for by SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, the bandits that tell your pols what to do
<|endoftext|>
I am at Trump National Doral-best resort in U.S. Rory and Adam Scott are doing great! Watch on NBC at 3:00 P.M.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
The primary plaintiff in the phony Trump University suit wants to abandon the case. Disgraceful!
<|endoftext|>
Nancy Reagan, the wife of a truly great President, was an amazing woman. She will be missed!
<|endoftext|>
David Brooks, of the New York Times, is closing in on being the dumbest of them all. He doesn’t have a clue.
<|endoftext|>
Thank you Kentucky! #Trump2016#SuperSaturday
<|endoftext|>
Thank you Louisiana! #Trump2016#SuperSaturday
<|endoftext|>
Romney's failed advisors, like campaign mgr Stuart Stevens are all over TV telling people how to win. But they lost- don't know how to win!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you, Kansas! The line going into the Orlando event is over a mile long. Massive crowd expected. Leaving Kansas now, be there soon!
<|endoftext|>
Getting ready to make my speech at #KansasCaucus. A great honor! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
<|endoftext|>
Thank you Kansas! Thousands of people inside- and thousands outside who couldn't get into the hall. Really amazing! #CaucusForTrump
<|endoftext|>
To the people of Kentucky, Rand Paul didn't want you. Now he runs back due to his presidential failure. #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
<|endoftext|>
Why would anyone in Kentucky listen to failed presidential candidate Rand Paul re: caucus. Made a fool of himself (1%.)KY his 2nd choice!
<|endoftext|>
Will be in Orlando, Florida, this afternoon. 25,000 people expected. This is a movement like our GREAT COUNTRY has never seen before!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, big lines in Kansas.
<|endoftext|>
For all of today's voters please remember that I am the only candidate that is self funding my campaign, I am not bought and paid for!
<|endoftext|>
Great time last night in Louisiana. Big and energetic crowd. Go out and vote now, polls open. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
I am in Kansas. Will be an exciting day. Big speech this morning in Wichita, and then go to caucus. Sorry CPAC (the format was fine!).
<|endoftext|>
Rubio puts out ad that my pilot was a drug dealer- not true, not my pilot! Guy owned helicopter company- don't think I ever even used.
<|endoftext|>
On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it!
<|endoftext|>
On my way to see the great people of Maine. Will be landing in Portland in 2 hours. Look forward to it! #Trump2016
<|endoftext|>
Go to Trump Doral in Miami and watch the World Golf Championship! On NOW!
<|endoftext|>
The phony lawsuit against Trump U could have been easily settled by me but I want  to go to court. 98% approval rating by students. Easy win
<|endoftext|>
Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago?
<|endoftext|>
"I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton. I am not a Mitt Romney, who doesn't know how to win. Hillary wants no part of ""Trump"""
<|endoftext|>
Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who, as a Senator, never even shows up to vote - worst record. Marco Rubio is a joke!
<|endoftext|>
I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party, while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement!
<|endoftext|>
"Failed candidate Mitt Romney,who ran one of the worst races in presidential history,is working with the establishment to bury a big ""R"" win!"
<|endoftext|>
Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger!
<|endoftext|>
Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio &amp, Cruz.When you see them think of your puppet POLS
<|endoftext|>
Because of me, the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters, a record. If they are not careful, they will all leave. Sad!
<|endoftext|>
Just another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack Obama. (2/2)
<|endoftext|>
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney is having a news conference tomorrow to criticize me. (1/2)
<|endoftext|>
Why can't the leaders of the Republican Party see that I am bringing in new voters by the millions-we are creating a larger, stronger party!
<|endoftext|>
Marco Rubio lost big last night. I even beat him in Virginia, where he spent so much time and money. Now his bosses are desperate and angry!
<|endoftext|>
Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. Check out his credit card scam, his house sale &amp, his no show voting!
<|endoftext|>
The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T.V. ads on me.
<|endoftext|>
Thank you Vermont! #Trump2016#SuperTuesday
<|endoftext|>
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley!
<|endoftext|>
Great news- Former Mayor of Dallas, Tom Leppert, has just endorsed me! Thank you! Tomorrow is a big day- VOTE! #VoteTrump #SuperTuesday
<|endoftext|>
Trump University has a 98% approval rating. I could have settled but won't out of principle!
<|endoftext|>
I will be making a big surprise announcement to the massive crowd assembled in Huntsville/Madison Alabama! Landing now! #Trump2016
<|endoftext|>
Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is polling very poorly in Florida. The people can't stand him for missing so many votes - poor work ethic!
<|endoftext|>
Mitt Romney didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 21, 2012, and then only after being humiliated by Harry R! A bad messenger for estab!
<|endoftext|>
Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them. He is another all talk, no action pol!
<|endoftext|>
"Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida, is set to be the ""puppet"" of the special interest Koch brothers. WATCH!"
<|endoftext|>
Making a big speech in Alabama today. So many people we had to move to a football stadium! Come and join us!
<|endoftext|>
I am the only Republican who will get large numbers of Dems and Indies (crossover). I will also get states that no other Republican can get.
<|endoftext|>
While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins, Repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles.GROWING PARTY
<|endoftext|>
"The Republican Establishment has been pushing for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio to say anything to ""hit"" Trump.I signed the pledge-careful"
<|endoftext|>
While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil), word is they have chosen little Marco Rubio, the lightweight from Florida
<|endoftext|>
Just watched lightweight Marco Rubio lying to a small crowd about my past record. He is not as smart as Cruz, and may be an even bigger liar
<|endoftext|>
I started my business with very little and built it into a great company, with some of the best real estate assets in the World. Amazing!
<|endoftext|>
I only wish my wonderful father, Fred, gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn't - total fabrication!
<|endoftext|>
Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people!
<|endoftext|>
I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz!
<|endoftext|>
Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit, no problem!
<|endoftext|>
I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S. almost every single year. I have rich friends who never get audited. I wonder why?
<|endoftext|>
They don't like Rubio in Florida- he left them high &amp, dry. Doesn't even show up for votes!
<|endoftext|>
Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker! Mr. Meltdown.
<|endoftext|>
Wow, every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor!
<|endoftext|>
Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material!
<|endoftext|>
Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker  Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed!
<|endoftext|>
Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early! Big announcement to be made!
<|endoftext|>
Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit!
<|endoftext|>
Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday. Cruz is a nasty guy, not one Senate endorsement and, despite talk, gets nothing done. Loser!
<|endoftext|>
I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth, Texas. Really big crowd expected. Will be talking about the debate last night-plus, plus!
<|endoftext|>
FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar!
<|endoftext|>
Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina, it's over. He didn't win- and lost to me in a landslide!
<|endoftext|>
Just for your info, tax returns have 0 to do w/ someone’s net worth. I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC. They are great!
<|endoftext|>
Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope!
<|endoftext|>
When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear, I will get most of his votes - no problem!
<|endoftext|>
"Why would Texans vote for ""liar"" Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada, lived there for 4 years-and remained a Canadian citizen until recently"
<|endoftext|>
When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around, he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win!
<|endoftext|>
Mitt Romney,who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough guy
<|endoftext|>
The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters. That is how I got to 46%. When others drop out, I will pick up more.  Sad but true
<|endoftext|>
Make sure you get on the Trump line and are not mislead by the Cruz people. They are bad! BE CAREFUL.
<|endoftext|>
GO VOTE FROM NOW TO 8:30 P.M. NEVADA. I WILL BE AT VARIOUS CAUCUS SITES. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Club for Growth is the group that came to my office seeking $1 million dollars. I told them no and now they are doing negative ads.
<|endoftext|>
Wow, great Ohio poll. Shows me leading by 5 points, beating K!
<|endoftext|>
Unlike the other Republican candidates, I will be in Nevada all day and night - I won't be fleeing, in and out. I love &amp, invest in Nevada!
<|endoftext|>
I am growing the Republican Party tremendously - just look at the numbers, way up! Democrats numbers are significantly down from years past.
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again! The Evangelicals in S.C. figured him out &amp, said no!
<|endoftext|>
"Ted Cruz does not have the right ""temperment"" to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!"
<|endoftext|>
Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked.
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.
<|endoftext|>
Thank you Michigan! #VoteTrumpMITrump 35%Kasich 17%Cruz 12%Rubio 12%Carson 9% Via: ARG
<|endoftext|>
Just watched the very incompetent Mitt Romney Campaign Strategist, Stuart Stevens. Now I know why Mitt lost so badly. Stevens is a clown!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you Illinois! Great news! #VoteTrumpIL on 3/15!Trump 28%Cruz 15%Rubio 14%Kasich 13%Bush 8%Carson 6%Simon Poll/SIU
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad.
<|endoftext|>
Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false, more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!
<|endoftext|>
It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve, and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.
<|endoftext|>
Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate. I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry!
<|endoftext|>
I hear the Rickets family, who own the Chicago Cubs, are secretly spending $'s against me. They better be careful, they have a lot to hide!
<|endoftext|>
The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S.C. is because he is a world class LIAR, and Evangelicals do not like liars!
<|endoftext|>
I am in Las Vegas, at the best hotel (by far), Trump International. I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada!
<|endoftext|>
A number of months ago, I was not expected to win South Carolina,Ted Cruz was, and yet I won in a landslide - every group and category. WIN!
<|endoftext|>
I will be live on all of the major morning talk shows. Enjoy!
<|endoftext|>
What a great night. Thank you South Carolina, a special place with truly amazing people! LOVE
<|endoftext|>
People (pundits) gave me no chance in South Carolina. Now it looks like a possible win. I would be happy with a one vote victory! (HOPE)
<|endoftext|>
South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. Vote now (today), and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration. South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in. Don't allow it
<|endoftext|>
I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!
<|endoftext|>
I am the only candidate (in many years) who is self-funding his campaign. Lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates!
<|endoftext|>
Lying #Ted Cruz just (on election day) came out with a sneak and sleazy Robocall. He holds up the Bible but in fact is a true lowlife pol!
<|endoftext|>
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Just finished two major speeches in South Carolina. Big crowds, great people. Going for a third now!
<|endoftext|>
Boycott all Apple products  until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal
<|endoftext|>
Hopefully others will follow suit. Our country needs &amp, should demand security. It is time to get tough &amp, be smart!
<|endoftext|>
I use both iPhone &amp, Samsung. If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info.
<|endoftext|>
Remember, Cruz and Bush gave us Roberts who upheld #ObamaCare twice! I am the only one who will #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
I’m self-funding and I am going to take care of the people – not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates.
<|endoftext|>
I will replace it with private plans, health savings accounts, &amp, allow purchasing across state lines. Maximum choice &amp, freedom for consumer.
<|endoftext|>
I was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions. I will eliminate the law, in its entirety, &amp, replace it w/ something much better.
<|endoftext|>
I was asked about healthcare by Anderson Cooper &amp, have been consistent- I will repeal all of #ObamaCare, including the mandate, period.
<|endoftext|>
I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar!
<|endoftext|>
New CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump. The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke. No wonder WSJ is doing so badly!
<|endoftext|>
I love being in South Carolina. We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
The just out USA Today National Poll, where I lead by big numbers, shows that in a head to head matchup, I beat both Hillary and Bernie.
<|endoftext|>
Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls, the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll.
<|endoftext|>
Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool, but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada!
<|endoftext|>
I will beat Hillary easily, but Lindsey Graham says I won't, and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on?
<|endoftext|>
"Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I ""would never be president"" - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history!"
<|endoftext|>
New PPP Poll just out - Trump up big, Cruz, Rubio and Bush down. The debate results, even with a stacked RNC audience, were wonderful!
<|endoftext|>
Spent the full day at meetings and a major rally yesterday in South Carolina. Great people and spirit. Today will be more of the same.
<|endoftext|>
I'd like to call JEB a liar, but the truth is he has no clue &amp, never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! (1/2)
<|endoftext|>
Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!
<|endoftext|>
I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG, BIG, BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
<|endoftext|>
Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada
<|endoftext|>
Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy, now brother!
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!
<|endoftext|>
Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists &amp, special interests - the bosses!
<|endoftext|>
Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors &amp, special ints
<|endoftext|>
I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy!
<|endoftext|>
All polls have me winning debate big- Drudge, TIME, etc. Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty. He has zero cred- totally dishonest!
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz is a cheater! He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts!
<|endoftext|>
Wow! Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington &amp, Lee Mock Convention. I hope you are right - I will make you proud!
<|endoftext|>
The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY!
<|endoftext|>
Love the people of South Carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight.
<|endoftext|>
Wow, Jeb Bush, whose campaign is a total disaster, had to bring in mommy to take a slap at me. Not nice!
<|endoftext|>
Totally unauthorized, do not pay. I am self funding my campaign! Notice has just been withdrawn. #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
<|endoftext|>
The RNC, which is probably not on my side, just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC.
<|endoftext|>
Just got back from Tampa. It was an amazing evening with an even more amazing crowd - fantastic people! Will be in South Carolina tomorrow.
<|endoftext|>
11,000 inside venue tonight in Tampa! Broke record set by Elton John in 1988 w/out musical instruments! Another 5,000 outside. Will be back!
<|endoftext|>
After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me, they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect &amp, ill-informed ads.
<|endoftext|>
Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution, which naturally, they did not get.
<|endoftext|>
How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?
<|endoftext|>
"Lying Cruz put out a statement, “Trump &amp, Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage."" Cruz is the worst liar, crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3?"
<|endoftext|>
Just landed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Reports are out that lines are three quarters of a mile to get in. Wow! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
<|endoftext|>
Heading to Baton Rouge, Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
<|endoftext|>
"We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest ""pushpolls"" on me. We are watching!"
<|endoftext|>
Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!
<|endoftext|>
He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT
<|endoftext|>
Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!
<|endoftext|>
I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local!
<|endoftext|>
I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core.
<|endoftext|>
Big speech tonight in South Carolina - 7:00 P.M. Tremendous crowd!
<|endoftext|>
"So funny, Jeb Bush called me a ""highly gifted politician and a great entertainer"" - I assume that is a compliment!"
<|endoftext|>
Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to the people of  New Hampshire, I love you! Now, off to South Carolina.
<|endoftext|>
We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border. We will build a WALL and have security.
<|endoftext|>
We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare - and nobody can do that like me. We will save $'s and have much better healthcare!
<|endoftext|>
"ISIS is making big threats today - no respect for U.S.A. or our ""leader"" - If I win it will be a very different story,with very fast results"
<|endoftext|>
New Hampshire vote today -  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great!
<|endoftext|>
No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!
<|endoftext|>
"I know the ""Governors"" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!"
<|endoftext|>
Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign, he says he would end super PACs. Sad!
<|endoftext|>
Everybody is laughing at Jeb Bush-spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack. A pathetic figure!
<|endoftext|>
Jeb Bush is desperate - strongly in favor of #CommonCore and very weak on illegal immigration.
<|endoftext|>
Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad. He is a weak candidate!
<|endoftext|>
So far the Super Bowl is very boring - not nearly as exciting as politics - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
I am in New Hampshire having a great time! Loved the #GOPDebate last night! Everybody enjoy the Super Bowl. #SuperBowlSunday #SB50
<|endoftext|>
I love New Hampshire - will be an exciting evening!
<|endoftext|>
Heading to South Carolina, really big crowd! Will be back in New Hampshire tomorrow.#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
<|endoftext|>
Such great support in New Hampshire. So many people are working so hard to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
<|endoftext|>
I very much look forward to tomorrow’s debate in New Hampshire—so many things to say, so much at stake. It will be an incredible evening!
<|endoftext|>
Big storm in New Hampshire. Moved my event to Monday. Will be there next four days.
<|endoftext|>
Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. He would be so easy to beat!
<|endoftext|>
"Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for ""deceit and dirty tricks and lies."""
<|endoftext|>
Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!
<|endoftext|>
The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!
<|endoftext|>
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
<|endoftext|>
"And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and ""choice"" - a total lie!"
<|endoftext|>
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
<|endoftext|>
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!
<|endoftext|>
Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long, rambling, overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!
<|endoftext|>
I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign, the only one. I will keep doing, but not worth it!
<|endoftext|>
I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd
<|endoftext|>
The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!
<|endoftext|>
Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz &amp, Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor
<|endoftext|>
My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice
<|endoftext|>
It all begins today - WE WILL FINALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
So nice to get an endorsement from the founder and owner of Pizza Ranch in Iowa! A great guy and great places! #CaucusForTrump
<|endoftext|>
If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also, VETS got $6,000,000.
<|endoftext|>
"By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing ""unfairness"" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS."
<|endoftext|>
Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal &amp, replace. He lies!
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam!
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!
<|endoftext|>
I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife, Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!
<|endoftext|>
"The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters ""in violation."" They are now under investigation. Bad!"
<|endoftext|>
I will be in Iowa all day and until Tuesday morning. Finally, after all these years of watching stupidity, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk. Not presidential material!
<|endoftext|>
The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?
<|endoftext|>
They say that if I participated in last night’s Fox debate, they would have had 12 million more &amp, would have broken the all time record.
<|endoftext|>
Getting ready to take off for Nashua, New Hampshire. Big crowd, will be there soon. Fun!
<|endoftext|>
Iowa was amazing last night. The event could not have worked out better. We raised $6,000,000 for our great vets. They were so happy &amp, proud
<|endoftext|>
An unbelievable night in Iowa with our great Veterans! We raised $6,000,000.00 while the politicians talked! #GOPDebate
<|endoftext|>
"The ""debate"" tonight will be a total disaster - low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock. I hate to see this."
<|endoftext|>
Wow, two candidates called last night and said they want to go to my event tonight at Drake University.
<|endoftext|>
On Greta, 87% of the people said they would not watch the debate if I'm not in it. Wow- what an honor!
<|endoftext|>
FOX debate advertising rates falling like a rock! Tune into my special event for the Veterans at 9pm EST!
<|endoftext|>
Even though I beat him in the first six debates, especially the last one, Ted Cruz wants to debate me again. Can we do it in Canada?
<|endoftext|>
Just got to listen to Rush Limbaugh - the guy is fantastic!
<|endoftext|>
I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter!
<|endoftext|>
Great honor- Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University, one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation, has just endorsed me!
<|endoftext|>
Just landed in New Hampshire. Will be at the venue shortly. #FITN
<|endoftext|>
Leaving now for New Hampshire. Big crowd- looking forward to it! #FITN
<|endoftext|>
Cruz lies are almost as bad as Jeb's. These politicians will do anything to stay at the trough!
<|endoftext|>
Cruz going down fast in recent polls- dropping like a rock. Lies never work!
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz is a nervous wreck. He is making reckless charges not caring for the truth! His poll #'s are way down!
<|endoftext|>
I will be on Morning's with Maria on the Fox Business Network tomorrow during the 7am and 8am ET hours.
<|endoftext|>
It's time for Ted Cruz to either settle his problem with the FACT that he was born in Canada and was a citizen of Canada, or get out of race
<|endoftext|>
Just left a great event in Pella. Going to church tomorrow in Muscatine, Iowa.
<|endoftext|>
Heading now to Pella, Iowa. Big crowd! Remember, Trump is a big buyer of Pella windows. See you soon!
<|endoftext|>
Just left Sioux Center, Iowa. My speech was very well received. Truly great people! Packed house- overflow!
<|endoftext|>
Heading to Sioux County, Iowa, where the crowd is amazing. Dr. Robert Jeffress will make the introduction. Make America Great Again!
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big. Because he was born in Canada and was, until recently, a Canadian citizen, many believe he cannot run!
<|endoftext|>
I am in Iowa watching all of these phony T.V. ads by the other candidates. All bull, politicians are all talk and no action-it won't happen!
<|endoftext|>
I am in Iowa. Will be making two speeches today. Good luck to all of the great folks on the East coast. Enjoy the beauty of the storm!
<|endoftext|>
Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. &amp, is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans. No legal disclosure &amp, never sold off assets.
<|endoftext|>
Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.
<|endoftext|>
Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!
<|endoftext|>
Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb --- mom can't help you with ISIS, the Chinese or with Putin.
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on? Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada?
<|endoftext|>
Rush Limbaugh is great, tells it as he sees it---really honorable guy! Thanks Rush! #Trump2016
<|endoftext|>
The tax scam Washington Post does among the most inaccurate stories of all. Really dishonest reporting.
<|endoftext|>
Wow! New National Zogby Poll just out:.TRUMP 45. CRUZ 13. RUBIO 8. Big numbers.
<|endoftext|>
Leaving Nevada now for Iowa. Things are looking good - great new polls!
<|endoftext|>
Blowout numbers on New Jobs and, separately, Services. Market up!
<|endoftext|>
"Highly respected Constitutional law professor Mary Brigid McManamon has just stated, ""Ted Cruz is not eligible to be President."" Big problem"
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz complains about my views on eminent domain, but without it we wouldn't have roads, highways, airports, schools or even pipelines.
<|endoftext|>
The late, great, William F. Buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize, the dying National Review!
<|endoftext|>
Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize, but not how to lead.
<|endoftext|>
National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad!
<|endoftext|>
“Palin’s brand among evangelicals is as gold as the faucets in Trump tower,” said Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Faith &amp, Freedom Coalition.
<|endoftext|>
"Wow, the highly respected Governor of Iowa just stated that ""Ted Cruz must be defeated."" Big shoker! People do not like Ted."
<|endoftext|>
Really disgusting that the failing New York Times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories.
<|endoftext|>
Wow, new polls just out have Trump up and Cruz down - he is a nervous wreck!
<|endoftext|>
I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt!
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks!
<|endoftext|>
Leaving for Liberty University. I'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd. #Trump2016
<|endoftext|>
I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money, not controlled.  Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses.
<|endoftext|>
Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S., or we won't have a country anymore!
<|endoftext|>
Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S., rather Airbus!
<|endoftext|>
In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion, 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others!
<|endoftext|>
Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, &amp, $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite
<|endoftext|>
Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!
<|endoftext|>
If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!
<|endoftext|>
"Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a ""natural born Canadian,"" did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?"
<|endoftext|>
Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.
<|endoftext|>
The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!
<|endoftext|>
Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!
<|endoftext|>
"Ted Cruz said he ""didn't know"" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable"
<|endoftext|>
Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so
<|endoftext|>
More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.
<|endoftext|>
Just got back from Iowa - had a great time with amazing people. Will be back soon!
<|endoftext|>
Sen. Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush.
<|endoftext|>
Jeb Bush, who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero, just got Graham endorsement. Graham quit at O.
<|endoftext|>
Do you think Iran would have acted so tough if they were Russian sailors? Our country was humiliated.
<|endoftext|>
United States looks more and more like a paper tiger. Won't be that way if I win!
<|endoftext|>
Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures &amp, images. We are weak. I will NOT forget!
<|endoftext|>
Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!
<|endoftext|>
Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW!
<|endoftext|>
Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!
<|endoftext|>
The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!
<|endoftext|>
The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic - very hard to watch!
<|endoftext|>
The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia. #SOTU
<|endoftext|>
On my way to Cedar Falls, Iowa, now. Will be great--I love the people of Iowa!
<|endoftext|>
The Tonight Show begins in 5 minutes. Enjoy!
<|endoftext|>
Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!
<|endoftext|>
UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.
<|endoftext|>
This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.
<|endoftext|>
If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn’t questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can’t win.
<|endoftext|>
Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...
<|endoftext|>
Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!
<|endoftext|>
Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding!
<|endoftext|>
I want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day. The crowds were amazing. Will be back Tuesday!
<|endoftext|>
I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in!
<|endoftext|>
(1/2) Time Magazine has me on the cover this week. David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had.
<|endoftext|>
"Constitutional law expert  #Laurence Tribe of Harvard says ""wrong to say it (natural born citizen) is a settled matter-it isn't settled)."
<|endoftext|>
South Carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun). I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies - packed houses. Love it!
<|endoftext|>
Great even in SC tonight! Fire Marshall would not let everyone in-- 5,000 turned away. Thank you for coming!
<|endoftext|>
Will be at venue, in wonderful South Carolina, very soon. Big traffic back-up, tremendous crowd! Will be wild.
<|endoftext|>
Love seeing union &amp, non-union members alike are defecting to Trump. I will create jobs like no one else. Their #Dem leaders can’t compete!
<|endoftext|>
Great time in Burlington, Vermont. Crowd was amazing.
<|endoftext|>
I'm leaving now for Burlington, Vermont. It will be wild!
<|endoftext|>
Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early!
<|endoftext|>
Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART!
<|endoftext|>
I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!
<|endoftext|>
Huge crowd expected tomorrow night! VT Police say first come, first serve. Arrive early!
<|endoftext|>
Germany is going through massive attacks to its people  by the migrants allowed to enter the country. New Years Eve was a disaster. THINK!
<|endoftext|>
The rally in Lowell, Massachusetts, was amazing. 10,000 people going wild. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
I look forward to being in Lowell, Massachusetts, today. I hear a very big crowd is expected--we will have lots of fun!
<|endoftext|>
The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch.
<|endoftext|>
Iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama, has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia &amp, their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT!
<|endoftext|>
Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch.
<|endoftext|>
Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!
<|endoftext|>
Al-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner &amp, if I speak out against them, which I must. Hillary lied!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video. The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate.
<|endoftext|>
Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening.
<|endoftext|>
Just arrived in Mississippi for the rally. Word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive. Will be an amazing evening!
<|endoftext|>
Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.!
<|endoftext|>
When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!
<|endoftext|>
I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!
<|endoftext|>
The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me. It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped!
<|endoftext|>
I will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night - hear the crowds are going to be massive! Look forward to it.
<|endoftext|>
Well, the year has officially begun. I have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around!
<|endoftext|>
HAPPY NEW YEAR! We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, and much faster than anyone thought possible!
<|endoftext|>
As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, I want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest Fake News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year. 2018 will be a great year for America!
<|endoftext|>
Iran, the Number One State of Sponsored Terror with numerous violations of Human Rights occurring on an hourly basis, has now closed down the Internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. Not good!
<|endoftext|>
Why would smart voters want to put Democrats in Congress in 2018 Election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the Election. People are much better off now not to mention ISIS, VA, Judges, Strong Border, 2nd A, Tax Cuts &amp, more?
<|endoftext|>
Big protests in Iran. The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. Looks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations!
<|endoftext|>
Jobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the U.S. Unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically Cut, and it will only get better. MUCH MORE TO COME!
<|endoftext|>
I use Social Media not because I like to, but because it is the only way to fight a VERY dishonest and unfair “press,” now often referred to as Fake News Media. Phony and non-existent “sources” are being used more often than ever. Many stories &amp, reports a pure fiction!
<|endoftext|>
Many reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with regime’s corruption &amp, its squandering of the nation’s wealth to fund terrorism abroad. Iranian govt should respect their people’s rights, including right to express themselves. The world is watching! #IranProtests
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration &amp, ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. We must protect our Country at all cost!
<|endoftext|>
Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!
<|endoftext|>
In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!
<|endoftext|>
Caught RED HANDED - very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea. There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen!
<|endoftext|>
Retail sales are at record numbers. We’ve got the economy going better than anyone ever dreamt - and you haven’t seen anything yet!
<|endoftext|>
Vanity Fair, which looks like it is on its last legs, is bending over backwards in apologizing for the minor hit they took at Crooked H. Anna Wintour, who was all set to be Amb to Court of St James’s &amp, a big fundraiser for CH, is beside herself in grief &amp, begging for forgiveness!
<|endoftext|>
Just left West Palm Beach Fire &amp, Rescue #2. Met with great men and women as representatives of those who do so much for all of us. Firefighters, paramedics, first responders - what amazing people they are!
<|endoftext|>
All signs are that business is looking really good for next year, only to be helped further by our Tax Cut Bill. Will be a great year for Companies and JOBS! Stock Market is poised for another year of SUCCESS!
<|endoftext|>
Based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate has been terminated as part of our Tax Cut Bill, which essentially Repeals (over time) ObamaCare, the Democrats &amp, Republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new HealthCare plan!
<|endoftext|>
I hope everyone is having a great Christmas, then tomorrow it’s back to work in order to Make America Great Again (which is happening faster than anyone anticipated)!
<|endoftext|>
People are proud to be saying Merry Christmas again. I am proud to have led the charge against the assault of our cherished and beautiful phrase. MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!
<|endoftext|>
The Tax Cut/Reform Bill, including Massive Alaska Drilling and the Repeal of the highly unpopular Individual Mandate, brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had. Don’t let the Fake News convince you otherwise...and our insider Polls are strong!
<|endoftext|>
The Fake News refuses to talk about how Big and how Strong our BASE is. They show Fake Polls just like they report Fake News. Despite only negative reporting, we are doing well - nobody is going to beat us. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Remember, the Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional races this year. In Senate, I said Roy M would lose in Alabama and supported Big Luther Strange - and Roy lost. Virginia candidate was not a “Trumper,” and he lost.  Good Republican candidates will win BIG!
<|endoftext|>
The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low. So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration, perhaps more than any other President in first year. Sadly, will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media!
<|endoftext|>
FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!
<|endoftext|>
How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin’ James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife’s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?
<|endoftext|>
Remember, the most hated part of ObamaCare is the Individual Mandate, which is being terminated under our just signed Tax Cut Bill.
<|endoftext|>
The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 in favor of additional Sanctions on North Korea. The World wants Peace, not Death!
<|endoftext|>
Congressman Ron DeSantis is a brilliant young leader, Yale and then Harvard Law, who would make a GREAT Governor of Florida. He loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER!
<|endoftext|>
95% of Americans will pay less or, at worst, the same amount of taxes (mostly far less). The Dems only want to raise your taxes!
<|endoftext|>
Will be signing the biggest ever Tax Cut and Reform Bill in 30 minutes in Oval Office. Will also be signing a much needed 4 billion dollar missile defense bill.
<|endoftext|>
With all my Administration has done on Legislative Approvals (broke Harry Truman’s Record), Regulation Cutting, Judicial Appointments, Building Military, VA, TAX CUTS &amp, REFORM, Record Economy/Stock Market and so much more, I am sure great credit will be given by mainstream news?
<|endoftext|>
“The President has accomplished some absolutely historic things during this past year.” Thank you Charlie Kirk of Turning Points USA. Sadly, the Fake Mainstream Media will NEVER talk about our accomplishments in their end of year reviews. We are compiling a long &amp, beautiful list.
<|endoftext|>
At some point, and for the good of the country, I predict we will start working with the Democrats in a Bipartisan fashion. Infrastructure would be a perfect place to start. After having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is time to start rebuilding our country!
<|endoftext|>
Our big and very popular Tax Cut and Reform Bill has taken on an unexpected new source of “love” - that is big companies and corporations showering their workers with bonuses. This is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of, and now it is the rage. Merry Christmas!
<|endoftext|>
House Democrats want a SHUTDOWN for the holidays in order to distract from the very popular, just passed, Tax Cuts. House Republicans, don’t let this happen. Pass the C.R. TODAY and keep our Government OPEN!
<|endoftext|>
Home Sales hit BEST numbers in 10 years! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
<|endoftext|>
The Massive Tax Cuts, which the Fake News Media is desperate to write badly about so as to please their Democrat bosses, will soon be kicking in and will speak for themselves. Companies are already making big payments to workers. Dems want to raise taxes, hate these big Cuts!
<|endoftext|>
The Tax Cuts are so large and so meaningful, and yet the Fake News is working overtime to follow the lead of their friends, the defeated Dems, and only demean. This is truly a case where the results will speak for themselves, starting very soon. Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!
<|endoftext|>
The United States Senate just passed the biggest in history Tax Cut and Reform Bill. Terrible Individual Mandate (ObamaCare)Repealed. Goes to the House tomorrow morning for final vote. If approved, there will be a News Conference at The White House at approximately 1:00 P.M.
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations to Paul Ryan, Kevin McCarthy, Kevin Brady, Steve Scalise, Cathy McMorris Rodgers and all great House Republicans who voted in favor of cutting your taxes!
<|endoftext|>
Stocks and the economy have a long way to go after the Tax Cut Bill is totally understood and appreciated in scope and size. Immediate expensing will have a big impact. Biggest Tax Cuts and Reform EVER passed. Enjoy, and create many beautiful JOBS!
<|endoftext|>
DOW RISES 5000 POINTS ON THE YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
70 Record Closes for the Dow so far this year! We have NEVER had 70 Dow Records in a one year period. Wow!
<|endoftext|>
My thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved in the train accident in DuPont, Washington. Thank you to all of our wonderful First Responders who are on the scene. We are currently monitoring here at the White House.
<|endoftext|>
The train accident that just occurred in DuPont, WA shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly. Seven trillion dollars spent in the Middle East while our roads, bridges, tunnels, railways (and more) crumble! Not for long!
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations to two great and hardworking guys, Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, on the success of their just out book, “Let Trump Be Trump.” Finally people with real knowledge are writing about our wonderful and exciting campaign!
<|endoftext|>
Republican Tax Cuts are looking very good. All are working hard. In the meantime, the Stock Market hit another record high!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you Omarosa for your service! I wish you continued success.
<|endoftext|>
If last night’s election proved anything, it proved that we need to put up GREAT Republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the House and Senate.
<|endoftext|>
The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election.  I was right! Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory. The write-in votes played a very big factor, but a win is a win. The people of Alabama are great, and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends!
<|endoftext|>
Consumer Confidence is at an All-Time High, along with a Record High Stock Market. Unemployment is at a 17 year low. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Working to pass MASSIVE TAX CUTS (looking good).
<|endoftext|>
The people of Alabama will do the right thing. Doug Jones is Pro-Abortion, weak on Crime, Military and Illegal Immigration, Bad for Gun Owners and Veterans and against the WALL. Jones is a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet. Roy Moore will always vote with us. VOTE ROY MOORE!
<|endoftext|>
Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office “begging” for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill &amp, Crooked-USED!
<|endoftext|>
Despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent, the Democrats have been unable to show any collusion with Russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who I don’t know and/or have never met. FAKE NEWS!
<|endoftext|>
Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written, then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on America!
<|endoftext|>
Getting closer and closer on the Tax Cut Bill. Shaping up even better than projected. House and Senate working very hard and smart. End result will be not only important, but SPECIAL!
<|endoftext|>
Things are going really well for our economy, a subject the Fake News spends as little time as possible discussing! Stock Market hit another RECORD HIGH, unemployment is now at a 17 year low and companies are coming back into the USA. Really good news, and much more to come!
<|endoftext|>
Great Army - Navy Game. Army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF’S TROPHY! Congratulations!
<|endoftext|>
Great Army - Navy Game. Army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF’S TROPHY (last time was 1996). Wow! Congratulations!
<|endoftext|>
CNN’S slogan is CNN, THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS. Everyone knows this is not true, that this could, in fact, be a fraud on the American Public. There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN. Their slogan should be CNN, THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS!
<|endoftext|>
A big contingent of very enthusiastic Roy Moore fans at the rally last night. We can’t have a Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Democrat, Jones, in that important Alabama Senate seat. Need your vote to Make America Great Again! Jones will always vote against what we must do for our Country.
<|endoftext|>
Looks like another great day for the Stock Market. Consumer Confidence is at Record High. I guess somebody likes me (my policies)!
<|endoftext|>
GREAT EVENING last night in Pensacola, Florida. Arena was packed to the rafters, the crowd was loud, loving and really smart. They definitely get what’s going on. Thank you Pensacola!
<|endoftext|>
Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased. I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!
<|endoftext|>
LAST thing the Make America Great Again Agenda needs is a Liberal Democrat in Senate where we have so little margin for victory already. The Pelosi/Schumer Puppet Jones would vote against us 100% of the time. He’s bad on Crime, Life, Border, Vets, Guns &amp, Military. VOTE ROY MOORE!
<|endoftext|>
Big crowd expected today in Pensacola, Florida, for a Make America Great Again speech. We have done so much in so short a period of time...and yet are planning to do so much more! See you there!

National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day - “A day that will live in infamy!” December 7, 1941
<|endoftext|>
With the great vote on Cutting Taxes, this could be a big day for the Stock Market - and YOU!
<|endoftext|>
Putting Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Puppet Jones into office in Alabama would hurt our great Republican Agenda of low on taxes, tough on crime, strong on military and borders...&amp, so much more. Look at your 401-k’s since Election. Highest Stock Market EVER! Jobs are roaring back!
<|endoftext|>
Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama. We need his vote on stopping crime, illegal immigration, Border Wall, Military, Pro Life, V.A., Judges 2nd Amendment and more. No to Jones, a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet!
<|endoftext|>
Report: “ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE”  Now it all starts to make sense!
<|endoftext|>
After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.
<|endoftext|>
I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!
<|endoftext|>
Many people in our Country are asking what the “Justice” Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and “acid washed” 33,000 Emails? No justice!
<|endoftext|>
So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed, while Crooked Hillary Clinton, on that now famous FBI holiday “interrogation” with no swearing in and no recording, lies many times...and nothing happens to her? Rigged system, or just a double standard?
<|endoftext|>
I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!
<|endoftext|>
Biggest Tax Bill and Tax Cuts in history just passed in the Senate. Now these great Republicans will be going for final passage. Thank you to House and Senate Republicans for your hard work and commitment!
<|endoftext|>
Republicans Senators are working hard to pass the biggest Tax Cuts in the history of our Country. The Bill is getting better and better. This is a once in a generation chance. Obstructionist Dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit!
<|endoftext|>
The jury was not told the killer of Kate was a 7 time felon. The Schumer/Pelosi Democrats are so weak on Crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 Elections.
<|endoftext|>
The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border, always committing crimes and being violent, and yet this info was not used in court. His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. BUILD THE WALL!
<|endoftext|>
A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.
<|endoftext|>
The Dow just broke 24,000 for the first time (another all-time Record). If the Dems had won the Presidential Election, the Market would be down 50% from these levels and Consumer Confidence, which is also at an all-time high, would be “low and glum!”
<|endoftext|>
Stock Market hits new Record High. Confidence and enthusiasm abound. More great numbers coming out!
<|endoftext|>
The Chinese Envoy, who just returned from North Korea, seems to have had no impact on Little Rocket Man. Hard to believe his people, and the military, put up with living in such horrible conditions. Russia and China condemned the launch.
<|endoftext|>
Funny to hear the Democrats talking about the National Debt when President Obama doubled it in only 8 years!
<|endoftext|>
The only people who don’t like the Tax Cut Bill are the people that don’t understand it or the Obstructionist Democrats that know how really good it is and do not want the credit and success to go to the Republicans!
<|endoftext|>
Just spoke to President XI JINPING of China concerning the provocative actions of North Korea. Additional major sanctions will be imposed on North Korea today. This situation will be handled!
<|endoftext|>
So now that Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin? And will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the “unsolved mystery” that took place in Florida years ago? Investigate!
<|endoftext|>
So now tha Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin? And will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the “unsolved mystery” that took place in Florida years ago? Investigate!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for “inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.” But when will the top executives at NBC &amp, Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News. Check out Andy Lack’s past!
<|endoftext|>
Great day for Tax Cuts and the Republican Party. But the biggest Winner will be our great Country!
<|endoftext|>
Just won the lawsuit on leadership of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB. A big win for the Consumer!
<|endoftext|>
After North Korea missile launch, it's more important than ever to fund our gov't &amp, military! Dems shouldn't hold troop funding hostage for amnesty &amp, illegal immigration. I ran on stopping illegal immigration and won big. They can't now threaten a shutdown to get their demands.
<|endoftext|>
Meeting with “Chuck and Nancy” today about keeping government open and working. Problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked, are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes. I don’t see a deal!
<|endoftext|>
Melania, our great and very hard working First Lady, who truly loves what she is doing, always thought that “if you run, you will win.” She would tell everyone that, “no doubt, he will win.” I also felt I would win (or I would not have run) - and Country is doing great!
<|endoftext|>
At least 24 players kneeling this weekend at NFL stadiums that are now having a very hard time filling up. The American public is fed up with the disrespect the NFL is paying to our Country, our Flag and our National Anthem. Weak and out of control!
<|endoftext|>
New home sales reach a 10 year high. Stock Market has more record gains. Hopefully Republican Senators will give us the much needed Tax Cuts to keep it all going! Democrats want big Tax Increases.
<|endoftext|>
The Tax Cut Bill is coming along very well, great support. With just a few changes, some mathematical, the middle class and job producers can get even more in actual dollars and savings and the pass through provision becomes simpler and really works well!
<|endoftext|>
We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!
<|endoftext|>
Back in D.C., big week for Tax Cuts and many other things of great importance to our Country.  Senate Republicans will hopefully come through for all of us. The Tax Cut Bill is getting better and better. The end result will be great for ALL!
<|endoftext|>
Since the first day I took office, all you hear is the phony Democrat excuse for losing the election, Russia, Russia,Russia.  Despite this I have the economy booming and have possibly done more than any 10 month President. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
I endorsed Luther Strange in the Alabama Primary. He shot way up in the polls but it wasn’t enough. Can’t let Schumer/Pelosi win this race. Liberal Jones would be BAD!
<|endoftext|>
The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, Bad for our Military and our great Vets, Bad for our 2nd Amendment, AND WANTS TO RAISES TAXES TO THE SKY. Jones would be a disaster!
<|endoftext|>
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, has been a total disaster as run by the previous Administrations pick. Financial Institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public. We will bring it back to life!
<|endoftext|>
Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named “Man (Person) of the Year,” like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!
<|endoftext|>
Will be calling the President of Egypt in a short while to discuss the tragic terrorist attack, with so much loss of life. We have to get TOUGHER AND SMARTER than ever before, and we will. Need the WALL, need the BAN! God bless the people of Egypt.
<|endoftext|>
Horrible and cowardly terrorist attack on innocent and defenseless worshipers in Egypt. The world cannot tolerate terrorism, we must defeat them militarily and discredit the extremist ideology that forms the basis of their existence!
<|endoftext|>
After Turkey call I will be heading over to Trump National Golf Club, Jupiter, to play golf (quickly) with Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson. Then back to Mar-a-Lago for talks on bringing even more jobs and companies back to the USA!
<|endoftext|>
Will be speaking to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey this morning about bringing peace to the mess that I inherited in the Middle East. I will get it all done, but what a mistake, in lives and dollars (6 trillion), to be there in the first place!
<|endoftext|>
ObamaCare premiums are going up, up, up, just as I have been predicting for two years. ObamaCare is OWNED by the Democrats, and it is a disaster. But do not worry. Even though the Dems want to Obstruct, we will Repeal &amp, Replace right after Tax Cuts!
<|endoftext|>
Will be doing a live Thanksgiving Video Teleconference with Members of the Military at 9:00 A.M.  Afghanistan, Iraq, USS Monterey, Turkey &amp, Bahrain. Then going to Coast Guard Quarters, Florida.
<|endoftext|>
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
HAPPY THANKSGIVING, your Country is starting to do really well. Jobs coming back, highest Stock Market EVER, Military getting really strong, we will build the WALL, V.A. taking care of our Vets, great Supreme Court Justice, RECORD CUT IN REGS, lowest unemployment in 17 years....!

I have long given the order to help Argentina with the Search and Rescue mission of their missing submarine. 45 people aboard and not much time left. May God be with them and the people of Argentina!
<|endoftext|>
Will be having meetings and working the phones from the Winter White House in Florida (Mar-a-Lago). Stock Market hit new Record High yesterday - $5.5 trillion gain since E. Many companies coming back to the U.S. Military building up and getting very strong.
<|endoftext|>
The NFL is now thinking about a new idea - keeping teams in the Locker Room during the National Anthem next season. That’s almost as bad as kneeling! When will the highly paid Commissioner finally get tough and smart? This issue is killing your league!.....
<|endoftext|>
...LaVar, you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during Thanksgiving with your son in China, but no NBA contract to support you. But remember LaVar, shoplifting is NOT a little thing. It’s a really big deal, especially in China. Ungrateful fool!
<|endoftext|>
It wasn’t the White House, it wasn’t the State Department, it wasn’t father LaVar’s so-called people on the ground in China that got his son out of a long term prison sentence - IT WAS ME. Too bad! LaVar is just a poor man’s version of Don King, but without the hair. Just think..
<|endoftext|>
Marshawn Lynch of the NFL’s Oakland Raiders stands for the Mexican Anthem and sits down to boos for our National Anthem. Great disrespect! Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season. Attendance and ratings way down.
<|endoftext|>
Republican Senators are working very hard to get Tax Cuts and Tax Reform approved. Hopefully it will not be long and they do not want to disappoint the American public!
<|endoftext|>
Border Patrol Officer killed at Southern Border, another badly hurt. We will seek out and bring to justice those responsible. We will, and must, build the Wall!
<|endoftext|>
Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.
<|endoftext|>
Shoplifting is a very big deal in China, as it should be (5-10 years in jail), but not to father LaVar. Should have gotten his son out during my next trip to China instead. China told them why they were released. Very ungrateful!
<|endoftext|>
Sen. Jeff Flake(y), who is unelectable in the Great State of Arizona (quit race, anemic polls) was caught (purposely) on “mike” saying bad things about your favorite President. He’ll be a NO on tax cuts because his political career anyway is “toast.”
<|endoftext|>
Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton is the worst (and biggest) loser of all time. She just can’t stop, which is so good for the Republican Party. Hillary, get on with your life and give it another try in three years!
<|endoftext|>
Put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts. Under study for years. Will update soon with Secretary Zinke. Thank you!
<|endoftext|>
If Democrats were not such obstructionists and understood the power of lower taxes, we would be able to get many of their ideas into Bill!
<|endoftext|>
Great numbers on Stocks and the Economy. If we get Tax Cuts and Reform, we'll really see some great results!
<|endoftext|>
.And to think that just last week he was lecturing anyone who would listen about sexual harassment and respect for women. Lesley Stahl tape?

Big win today in the House for GOP Tax Cuts and Reform, 227-205. Zero Dems, they want to raise taxes much higher, but not for our military!

To the three UCLA basketball players I say:  You're welcome, go out and give a big Thank You to President Xi Jinping of China who made.....
<|endoftext|>
Big vote tomorrow in the House. Tax cuts are getting close!
<|endoftext|>
Why are Democrats fighting massive tax cuts for the middle class and business (jobs)? The reason: Obstruction and Delay!
<|endoftext|>
...They should realize that these relationships are a good thing, not a bad thing. The U.S. is being respected again. Watch Trade!
<|endoftext|>
Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump? They were headed for 10 years in jail!
<|endoftext|>
Our great country is respected again in Asia. You will see the fruits of our long but successful trip for many years to come!
<|endoftext|>
Just returned from Asia after 12 very successful days. Great to be home!
<|endoftext|>
May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived.
<|endoftext|>
Just arrived at #ASEAN50 in the Philippines for my final stop with World Leaders. Will lead to FAIR TRADE DEALS, unlike the horror shows from past Administrations. Will then be leaving for D.C. Made many good friends!
<|endoftext|>
FEMA and first responders are working hard (yet again) on Hurricane Nate. Military helping. Very much under control!
<|endoftext|>
After my tour of Asia, all Countries dealing with us on TRADE know that the rules have changed. The United States has to be treated fairly and in a reciprocal fashion. The massive TRADE deficits must go down quickly!
<|endoftext|>
Excited to be heading home to see the House pass a GREAT Tax Bill with the middle class getting big TAX CUTS!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain🇺🇸
<|endoftext|>
I am proud of the Rep. House &amp, Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {&amp, reform.} We’re getting close! Now, how about ending the unfair &amp, highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare &amp, reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?
<|endoftext|>
Happy to announce, I am nominating Alex Azar to be the next HHS Secretary. He will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!
<|endoftext|>
Will be leaving the Philippines tomorrow after many days of constant mtgs &amp, work in order to #MAGA! My promises are rapidly being fulfilled.

Just landed in the Philippines after a great day of meetings and events in Hanoi, Vietnam!

"Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ""old,"" when I would NEVER call him ""short and fat?"" Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!"
<|endoftext|>
Does the Fake News Media remember when Crooked Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, was begging Russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button? Obama tried also, but he had zero chemistry with Putin.
<|endoftext|>
When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. There always playing politics - bad for our country. I want to solve North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, terrorism, and Russia can greatly help!
<|endoftext|>
Met with President Putin of Russia who was at #APEC meetings. Good discussions on Syria. Hope for his help to solve, along with China the dangerous North Korea crisis. Progress being made.
<|endoftext|>
Will be doing a joint press conference in Hanoi, Vietnam then heading for final destination of trip, the Phillipines.
<|endoftext|>
President Xi of China has stated that he is upping the sanctions against #NoKo. Said he wants them to denuclearize. Progress is being made.
<|endoftext|>
Just landed in Da Nang, Vietnam to deliver a speech at #APEC2017
<|endoftext|>
My meetings with President Xi Jinping were very productive on both trade and the subject of North Korea. He is a highly respected and powerful representative of his people. It was great being with him and Madame Peng Liyuan!
<|endoftext|>
I don’t blame China, I blame the incompetence of past Admins for allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. on trade leading up to a point where the U.S. is losing $100's of billions. How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue? I would've done same!
<|endoftext|>
Leaving South Korea now heading to China. Looking very much forward to meeting and being with President Xi!
<|endoftext|>
Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for. Don’t forget, Republicans won 4 out of 4 House seats, and with the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!
<|endoftext|>
Getting ready to make a major speech to the National Assembly here in South Korea, then will be headed to China where I very much look forward to meeting with President Xi who is just off his great political victory.

Thank you to all Americans who participated in Nat'l Rx Drug Take Back Day. A record amount of drugs collected &amp, disposed. We can do this!

My visit to Japan and friendship with PM Abe will yield many benefits, for our great Country. Massive military &amp, energy orders happening+++!

The state of Virginia economy, under Democrat rule, has been terrible. If you vote Ed Gillespie tomorrow, it will come roaring back!

May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI &amp, law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.

The rigged Dem Primary, one of the biggest political stories in years, got ZERO coverage on Fake News Network TV last night. Disgraceful!
<|endoftext|>
I always felt I would be running and winning against Bernie Sanders, not Crooked H, without cheating, I was right.
<|endoftext|>
Bernie Sanders supporters have every right to be apoplectic of the complete theft of the Dem primary by Crooked Hillary!

"...Based on that, the Military has hit ISIS ""much harder"" over the last two days. They will pay a big price for every attack on us!"

Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI &amp, Justice Dept.

The real story on Collusion is in Donna B's new book. Crooked Hillary bought the DNC &amp, then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!
<|endoftext|>
....People are angry.  At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper. The American public deserves it!
<|endoftext|>
...New Donna B book says she paid for and stole the Dem Primary. What about the deleted E-mails, Uranium, Podesta, the Server, plus, plus...
<|endoftext|>
Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary &amp, the Dems..
<|endoftext|>
My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee. I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact.
<|endoftext|>
....This is real collusion and dishonesty. Major violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering - where is our Justice Department?

Donna Brazile just stated the DNC RIGGED the system to illegally steal the Primary from Bernie Sanders. Bought and paid for by Crooked H....

Great Tax Cut rollout today. The lobbyists are storming Capital Hill, but the Republicans will hold strong and do what is right for America!

Would love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantanamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system...
<|endoftext|>
NYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room. He killed 8 people, badly injured 12. SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!
<|endoftext|>
The United States will be immediately implementing much tougher Extreme Vetting Procedures. The safety of our citizens comes first!
<|endoftext|>
Just spoke to President Macri of Argentina about the five proud and wonderful men killed in the West Side terror attack. God be with them!
<|endoftext|>
....for the Middle Class. The House and Senate should consider ASAP as the process of final approval moves along. Push Biggest Tax Cuts EVER
<|endoftext|>
Wouldn't it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in ObamaCare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts.....
<|endoftext|>
"The terrorist came into our country through what is called the ""Diversity Visa Lottery Program,"" a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based."
<|endoftext|>
I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program. Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!
<|endoftext|>
The Republican House members are working hard (and late) toward the Massive Tax Cuts that they know you deserve. These will be biggest ever!
<|endoftext|>
My thoughts, condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack. God and your country are with you!
<|endoftext|>
We must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere. Enough!
<|endoftext|>
In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!
<|endoftext|>
....earth shattering. He and his brother could Drain The Swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled. Fake News weak!
<|endoftext|>
The biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm. What he know about Crooked Dems is....
<|endoftext|>
I hope people will start to focus on our Massive Tax Cuts for Business (jobs) and the Middle Class (in addition to Democrat corruption)!
<|endoftext|>
....came to the campaign. Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar. Check the DEMS!
<|endoftext|>
"The Fake News is working overtime. As Paul Manaforts lawyer said, there was ""no collusion"" and events mentioned took place long before he..."
<|endoftext|>
....Also, there is NO COLLUSION!
<|endoftext|>
Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary &amp, the Dems the focus?????
<|endoftext|>
Report out that Obama Campaign paid $972,000 to Fusion GPS. The firm also got $12,400,000 (really?) from DNC. Nobody knows who OK'd!
<|endoftext|>
"All of this ""Russia"" talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts &amp, Reform. Is this coincidental? NOT!"
<|endoftext|>
...are now fighting back like never before. There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out. DO SOMETHING!
<|endoftext|>
"...""collusion,"" which doesn't exist. The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics, but the R's..."
<|endoftext|>
...the Uranium to Russia deal, the  33,000 plus deleted Emails, the Comey fix and so much more. Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia,....

Never seen such Republican ANGER &amp, UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?),....
<|endoftext|>
As usual, the ObamaCare premiums will be up (the Dems own it), but we will Repeal &amp, Replace and have great Healthcare soon after Tax Cuts!
<|endoftext|>
JFK Files are released, long ahead of schedule!

...addresses of any mentioned person who is still living. I am doing this for reasons of full disclosure, transparency and...
<|endoftext|>
After strict consultation with General Kelly, the CIA and other Agencies, I will be releasing ALL #JFKFiles other than the names and...
<|endoftext|>
Just read the nice remarks by President Jimmy Carter about me and how badly I am treated by the press (Fake News). Thank you Mr. President!
<|endoftext|>
Very little reporting about the GREAT GDP numbers announced yesterday (3.0 despite the big hurricane hits). Best consecutive Q's in years!
<|endoftext|>
Diane Black of Tennessee, the highly respected House Budget Committee Chairwoman, did a GREAT job in passing Budget, setting up big Tax Cuts
<|endoftext|>
It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with HC!
<|endoftext|>
JFK Files are being carefully released. In the end there will be great transparency. It is my hope to get just about everything to public!
<|endoftext|>
Wacky &amp, totally unhinged Tom Steyer, who has been fighting me and my Make America Great Again agenda from beginning, never wins elections!
<|endoftext|>
Big news - Budget just passed!
<|endoftext|>
Do not underestimate the UNITY within the Republican Party!
<|endoftext|>
Ed Gillespie will be a great Governor of Virginia. His opponent doesn't even show up to meetings/work, and will be VERY weak on crime!
<|endoftext|>
Ed Gillespie will turn the really bad Virginia economy #'s around, and fast. Strong on crime, he might even save our great statues/heritage!
<|endoftext|>
The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow. So interesting!
<|endoftext|>
Spoke to President Xi of China to congratulate him on his extraordinary elevation. Also discussed NoKo &amp, trade, two very important subjects!
<|endoftext|>
"Jeff Flake, with an 18% approval rating in Arizona, said ""a lot of my colleagues have spoken out."" Really, they just gave me a standing O!"
<|endoftext|>
Working hard on the biggest tax cut in U.S. history. Great support from so many sides. Big winners will be the middle class, business &amp, JOBS
<|endoftext|>
The meeting with Republican Senators yesterday, outside of Flake and Corker, was a love fest with standing ovations and great ideas for USA!
<|endoftext|>
The reason Flake and Corker dropped out of the Senate race is very simple, they had zero chance of being elected. Now act so hurt &amp, wounded!
<|endoftext|>
So nice being with Republican Senators today. Multiple standing ovations! Most are great people who want big Tax Cuts and success for U.S.
<|endoftext|>
Stock Market just hit another record high! Jobs looking very good.
<|endoftext|>
...the entire World WAS laughing and taking advantage of us. People like liddle' Bob Corker have set the U.S. way back. Now we move forward!
<|endoftext|>
Sen. Corker is the incompetent head of the Foreign Relations Committee, &amp, look how poorly the U.S. has done. He doesn't have a clue as.....
<|endoftext|>
Isn't it sad that lightweight Senator Bob Corker, who couldn't get re-elected in the Great State of Tennessee, will now fight Tax Cuts plus!

...Corker dropped out of the race in Tennesse when I refused to endorse him, and now is only negative on anything Trump. Look at his record!
<|endoftext|>
Bob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal &amp, couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts....
<|endoftext|>
I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!
<|endoftext|>
Two dozen NFL players continue to kneel during the National Anthem, showing total disrespect to our Flag &amp, Country.  No leadership in NFL!
<|endoftext|>
There will be NO change to your 401(k). This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!
<|endoftext|>
It is finally sinking through. 46% OF PEOPLE BELIEVE MAJOR NATIONAL NEWS ORGS FABRICATE STORIES ABOUT ME. FAKE NEWS, even worse! Lost cred.
<|endoftext|>
Wacky Congresswoman Wilson is the gift that keeps on giving for the Republican Party, a disaster for Dems. You watch her in action &amp, vote R!
<|endoftext|>
...2nd Amendment, Strong Military, ISIS, historic VA improvement, Supreme Court Justice, Record Stock Market, lowest unemployment in 17 yrs!
<|endoftext|>
...9 months than this Administration. Over 50 Legislation approvals, massive regulation cuts, energy freedom, pipelines, border security....
<|endoftext|>
I agree getting Tax Cuts approved  is important (we will also get HealthCare), but perhaps no Administration has done more in its first.....
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on Presidential Election than I did. Facebook was on her side, not mine!
<|endoftext|>
"Keep hearing about ""tiny"" amount of money spent on Facebook ads. What about the billions of dollars of Fake News on CNN, ABC, NBC &amp, CBS?"
<|endoftext|>
"Officials behind the now discredited ""Dossier"" plead the Fifth. Justice Department and/or FBI should immediately release who paid for it."
<|endoftext|>
Stock Market hits another all time high on Friday. 5.3 trillion dollars up since Election. Fake News doesn't spent much time on this!
<|endoftext|>
Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.
<|endoftext|>
I hope the Fake News Media keeps talking about Wacky Congresswoman Wilson in that she, as a representative, is killing the Democrat Party!
<|endoftext|>
Budget that just passed is a really big deal, especially in terms of what will be the biggest tax cut in U.S. history - MSM barely covered!
<|endoftext|>
"Great book just out, ""A Place Called Heaven,"" by Dr. Robert Jeffress - A wonderful man!"
<|endoftext|>
"Just out report: ""United Kingdom crime rises 13% annually amid spread of Radical Islamic terror."" Not good, we must keep America safe!"
<|endoftext|>
....This now allows for the passage of large scale Tax Cuts (and Reform), which will be the biggest in the history of our country!
<|endoftext|>
The Budget passed late last night, 51 to 49. We got ZERO Democrat votes with only Rand Paul (he will vote for Tax Cuts) voting against.....
<|endoftext|>
The Fake News is going crazy with wacky Congresswoman Wilson(D), who was SECRETLY on a very personal call, and gave a total lie on content!
<|endoftext|>
Workers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th. Who paid for it, Russia, the FBI or the Dems (or all)?
<|endoftext|>
Uranium deal to Russia, with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge, is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn't want to follow!
<|endoftext|>
Republicans are going for the big Budget approval today, first step toward massive tax cuts. I think we have the votes, but who knows?
<|endoftext|>
I am supportive of Lamar as a person &amp, also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co's who have made a fortune w/ O'Care.
<|endoftext|>
Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!
<|endoftext|>
The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem. Total disrespect for our great country!
<|endoftext|>
As it has turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats will only vote for Tax Increases. Hopefully, all Senate Republicans will vote for the largest Tax Cuts in U.S. history.
<|endoftext|>
...people not interviewed, including Clinton herself. Comey stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?
<|endoftext|>
Wow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating  Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete. Many..
<|endoftext|>
"Any increase in ObamaCare premiums is the fault of the Democrats for giving us a ""product"" that never had a chance of working."
<|endoftext|>
Rep.Tom Marino has informed me that he is withdrawing his name from consideration as drug czar. Tom is a fine man and a great Congressman!

"I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020? My answer was, ""I hope so!"""
<|endoftext|>
The U.S. has gained more than 5.2 trillion dollars in Stock Market Value since Election Day! Also, record business enthusiasm.

Since Election Day on November 8, the Stock Market is up more than 25%, unemployment is at a 17 year low &amp, companies are coming back to U.S.
<|endoftext|>
Dem Senator Schumer hated the Iran deal made by President Obama, but now that I am involved, he is OK with it. Tell that to Israel, Chuck!
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats only want to increase taxes and obstruct. That's all they are good at!
<|endoftext|>
...approvals of The Keystone XL &amp, Dakota Access pipelines. Also, look at the recent EPA cancelations &amp, our great new Supreme Court Justice!
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats in the Southwest part of Virginia have been abandoned by their Party. Republican Ed Gillespie will never let you down!
<|endoftext|>
Very proud of my Executive Order which will allow greatly expanded access and far lower costs for HealthCare. Millions of people benefit!
<|endoftext|>
Health Insurance stocks, which have gone through the roof during the ObamaCare years, plunged yesterday after I ended their Dems windfall!
<|endoftext|>
ObamaCare is causing such grief and tragedy for so many. It is being dismantled but in the meantime, premiums &amp, deductibles are way up!
<|endoftext|>
Money pouring into Insurance Companies profits, under the guise of ObamaCare, is over. They have made a fortune.Dems must get smart &amp, deal!
<|endoftext|>
Many people talking, with much agreement, on my Iran speech today. Participants in the deal are making lots of money on trade with Iran!
<|endoftext|>
Starting to develop a much better relationship with Pakistan and its leaders. I want to thank them for their cooperation on many fronts.
<|endoftext|>
The wonderful people of Puerto Rico, with their unmatched spirit, know how bad things were before the H's. I will always be with them!
<|endoftext|>
Hard to believe that the Democrats, who have gone so far LEFT that they are no longer recognizable, are fighting so hard for Sanctuary crime
<|endoftext|>
ObamaCare is a broken mess. Piece by piece we will now begin the process of giving America the great HealthCare it deserves!
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding. Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!
<|endoftext|>
The Fake News Is going all out in order to demean and denigrate! Such hatred!
<|endoftext|>
...We cannot keep FEMA, the Military &amp, the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!

"""Puerto Rico survived the Hurricanes, now a financial crisis looms largely of their own making."" says Sharyl Attkisson. A total lack of....."
<|endoftext|>
Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked. Not fair to public!
<|endoftext|>
Happy to announce we are awarding $1M to Las Vegas - in order to help local law enforcement working OT to respond to last Sunday’s tragedy.
<|endoftext|>
With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!
<|endoftext|>
It is about time that Roger Goodell of the NFL is finally demanding that all players STAND for our great National Anthem-RESPECT OUR COUNTRY
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats want MASSIVE tax increases &amp, soft, crime producing borders.The Republicans want the biggest tax cut in history &amp, the WALL!
<|endoftext|>
It would be really nice if the Fake News Media would report the virtually unprecedented Stock Market growth since the election.Need tax cuts
<|endoftext|>
...if Congress gives us the massive tax cuts (and reform) I am asking for, those numbers will grow by leaps and bounds. #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
Stock Market has increased by 5.2 Trillion dollars since the election on November 8th, a 25% increase. Lowest unemployment in 16 years and..
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
The Fake News is at it again, this time trying to hurt one of the finest people I know, General John Kelly, by saying he will soon be.....
<|endoftext|>
"Highly respected author, Christopher Bedford, just came out with book, ""The Art of the Donald, Lessons from America's...."" Really good book!"
<|endoftext|>
"With Jemele Hill at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have ""tanked,"" in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!"
<|endoftext|>
Since Congress can't get its act together on HealthCare, I will be using the power of the pen to give great HealthCare to many people - FAST
<|endoftext|>
The problem with agreeing to a policy on immigration is that the Democrats don't want secure borders,they don't care about safety for U.S.A.
<|endoftext|>
Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!
<|endoftext|>
"A big salute to Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, who will BENCH players who disrespect our Flag.""Stand for Anthem or sit for game!"""
<|endoftext|>
Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years, giving billions of dollars &amp, getting nothing. Policy didn't work!
<|endoftext|>
Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, &amp, that's about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!
<|endoftext|>
...Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn't have the guts to run!
<|endoftext|>
"..my endorsement). He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said ""NO THANKS."" He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!"
<|endoftext|>
"Senator Bob Corker ""begged"" me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said ""NO"" and he dropped out (said he could not win without..."
<|endoftext|>
Leaving the White House for the Great State of North Carolina. Big progress being made on many fronts!
<|endoftext|>
...hasn't worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, makings fools of U.S. negotiators. Sorry, but only one thing will work!
<|endoftext|>
Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid......
<|endoftext|>
I called Chuck Schumer yesterday to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill. ObamaCare is badly broken, big premiums. Who knows!
<|endoftext|>
More and more people are suggesting that Republicans (and me) should be given Equal Time on T.V. when you look at the one-sided coverage?
<|endoftext|>
"Late Night host are dealing with the Democrats for their very ""unfunny"" &amp, repetitive material, always anti-Trump! Should we get Equal Time?"
<|endoftext|>
...contributions. The RNC is taking in far more $'s than the Dems, and much of it by my wonderful small donors. I am working hard for them!
<|endoftext|>
Ralph Northam,who is running for Governor of Virginia,is fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs &amp, sanctuary cities.  Vote Ed Gillespie!
<|endoftext|>
Stock Market hits an ALL-TIME high! Unemployment lowest in 16 years! Business and manufacturing enthusiasm at highest level in decades!
<|endoftext|>
Why Isn't the Senate Intel Committee looking into the Fake News Networks in OUR country to see why so much of our news is just made up-FAKE!
<|endoftext|>
So wonderful to be in Las Vegas yesterday and meet with people, from police to doctors to the victims themselves, who I will never forget!
<|endoftext|>
NBC news is #FakeNews and more dishonest than even CNN. They are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down!
<|endoftext|>
Was with great people last night in Fort Myer, Virginia. The future of our country is strong!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, so many Fake News stories today. No matter what I do or say, they will not write or speak truth. The Fake News Media is out of control!
<|endoftext|>
A great day in Puerto Rico yesterday. While some of the news coverage is Fake, most showed great warmth and friendship.
<|endoftext|>
"It is a ""miracle"" how fast the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police were able to find the demented shooter and stop him from even more killing!"

I am so proud of our great Country. God bless America!

My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you!
<|endoftext|>
Being nice to Rocket Man hasn't worked in 25 years, why would it work now? Clinton failed, Bush failed, and Obama failed. I won't fail.
<|endoftext|>
...Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!
<|endoftext|>
I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man...

...for safety. Thank you to the Governor of P.R. and to all of those who are working so closely with our First Responders. Fantastic job!
<|endoftext|>

Very important that NFL players STAND tomorrow, and always, for the playing of our National Anthem. Respect our Flag and our Country!
<|endoftext|>
I will be in PR on Tues. to further ensure we continue doing everything possible to assist &amp, support the people in their time of great need.
<|endoftext|>
Results of recovery efforts will speak much louder than complaints by San Juan Mayor. Doing everything we can to help great people of PR!
<|endoftext|>
We must all be united in offering assistance to everyone suffering in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the wake of this terrible disaster.
<|endoftext|>
To the people of Puerto Rico:Do not believe the #FakeNews!#PRStrong🇵🇷
<|endoftext|>
Congresswoman Jennifer Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto Rico has been wonderful to deal with and a great representative of the people. Thank you!
<|endoftext|>
Just spoke to Governor Kenneth Mapp of the U.S. Virgin Islands who stated that #FEMA and Military are doing a GREAT job! Thank you Governor!
<|endoftext|>
The Governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossello, is a great guy and leader who is really working hard. Thank you Ricky!
<|endoftext|>
Despite the Fake News Media in conjunction with the Dems, an amazing job is being done in Puerto Rico. Great people!
<|endoftext|>
The Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first R's. Shame!
<|endoftext|>
I will be going to Puerto Rico on Tuesday with Melania. Will hopefully be able to stop at the U.S. Virgin Islands (people working hard).
<|endoftext|>
"Fake News CNN and NBC are going out of their way to disparage our great First Responders as a way to ""get Trump."" Not fair to FR or effort!"
<|endoftext|>
The military and first responders, despite no electric, roads, phones etc., have done an amazing job. Puerto Rico was totally destroyed.
<|endoftext|>
...want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.
<|endoftext|>
...Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They....
<|endoftext|>
The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump.
<|endoftext|>
RECORD HIGH FOR S &amp, P 500!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to FEMA, our great Military &amp, all First Responders who are working so hard,against terrible odds,in Puerto Rico. See you Tuesday!
<|endoftext|>
...The fact is that Puerto Rico has been destroyed by two hurricanes. Big decisions will have to be made as to the cost of its rebuilding!
<|endoftext|>
"Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello just stated: ""The Administration and the President, every time we've spoken, they've delivered......"
<|endoftext|>
GDP was revised upward to 3.1 for last quarter. Many people thought it would be years before that happened. We have just begun!
<|endoftext|>
"Puerto Rico is devastated. Phone system, electric grid many roads, gone. FEMA and First Responders are amazing. Governor said ""great job!"""
<|endoftext|>
...really hard to help but many have lost their homes. Military is now on site and I will be there Tuesday. Wish press would treat fairly!
<|endoftext|>
FEMA &amp, First Responders are doing a GREAT job in Puerto Rico. Massive food &amp, water delivered. Docks &amp, electric grid dead. Locals trying....
<|endoftext|>
The electric power grid in Puerto Rico is totally shot. Large numbers of generators are now on Island. Food and water on site.
<|endoftext|>
Democrats don't want massive tax cuts - how does that win elections? Great reviews for Tax Cut and Reform Bill.
<|endoftext|>
..But the people were Pro-Trump! Virtually no President has accomplished what we have accomplished in the first 9 months-and economy roaring
<|endoftext|>
We will have the votes for Healthcare but not for the reconciliation deadline of Friday, after which we need 60. Get rid of Filibuster Rule!
<|endoftext|>
With one Yes vote in hospital &amp, very positive signs from Alaska and two others (McCain is out), we have the HCare Vote, but not for Friday!
<|endoftext|>
Spoke to Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys yesterday. Jerry is a winner who knows how to get things done. Players will stand for Country!
<|endoftext|>
Spoke to Roy Moore of Alabama last night for the first time. Sounds like a really great guy who ran a fantastic race. He will help to #MAGA!
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations to Roy Moore on his Republican Primary win in Alabama. Luther Strange started way back &amp, ran a good race. Roy, WIN in Dec!

Congratulations to Roy Moore on his Republican Primary win in Alabama. Luther Strange started way back &amp, ran a good race. Roy, WIN in Nov!
<|endoftext|>
70 years ago today, the National Security Council met for the first time. Great history of advising Presidents-then &amp, now! Thanks NSC Staff!
<|endoftext|>
ALABAMA, get out and vote for Luther Strange - he has proven to me that he will never let you down! #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
The NFL has all sorts of rules and regulations. The only way out for them is to set a rule that you can't kneel during our National Anthem!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to Carmen Yulin Cruz, the Mayor of San Juan, for your kind words on FEMA etc.We are working hard. Much food and water there/on way
<|endoftext|>
"Luther Strange has been shooting up in the Alabama polls since my endorsement. Finish the job - vote today for ""Big Luther."""
<|endoftext|>
But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team, they all stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made-we all love our country!
<|endoftext|>
...But while Dallas dropped to it knees as a team, they ALL stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made - we love our country!
<|endoftext|>
The booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger
<|endoftext|>
Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts, when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!
<|endoftext|>
Big election tomorrow in the Great State of Alabama. Vote for Senator Luther Strange, tough on crime &amp, border - will never let you down!
<|endoftext|>
...owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with. Food, water and medical are top priorities - and doing well. #FEMA
<|endoftext|>
...It's old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated. Much of the Island was destroyed, with billions of dollars....
<|endoftext|>
Texas &amp, Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure &amp, massive debt, is in deep trouble..
<|endoftext|>
Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country.#StandForOurAnthem🇺🇸
<|endoftext|>
General John Kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on NFL players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our FLAG or GREAT COUNTRY!
<|endoftext|>
#StandForOurAnthem
<|endoftext|>
The White House never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night. Important meetings taking place today. Big tax cuts &amp, reform.
<|endoftext|>
The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!
<|endoftext|>
Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total). These are fans who demand respect for our Flag!
<|endoftext|>
So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans. They won't put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear!
<|endoftext|>
Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!
<|endoftext|>
Alaska, Arizona, Maine and Kentucky are big winners in the Healthcare proposal. 7 years of Repeal &amp, Replace and some Senators not there.
<|endoftext|>
Courageous Patriots have fought and died for our great American Flag --- we MUST honor and respect it!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Please to inform that the Champion Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL will be joining me at the White House for Ceremony. Great team!
<|endoftext|>
Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!
<|endoftext|>
...NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.
<|endoftext|>
If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag &amp, Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!
<|endoftext|>
Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!
<|endoftext|>
Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.Tell them to stand!
<|endoftext|>
"Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a ""moment of courage."" Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived. 116% increase!"
<|endoftext|>
Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.They are also working with North Korea.Not much of an agreement we have!
<|endoftext|>
...our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!
<|endoftext|>
If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect....
<|endoftext|>
Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!
<|endoftext|>
It was great being with Luther Strange last night in Alabama. What great people, what a crowd! Vote Luther on Tuesday.
<|endoftext|>
Alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under ObamaCare, worst in the country. Deductibles high, people angry! Lisa M comes through.
<|endoftext|>
I know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the Party!
<|endoftext|>
Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do. Better control &amp,  management. Great for Arizona. McCain let his best friend L.G. down!
<|endoftext|>
Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year, with deductibles very high. Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods. Sad
<|endoftext|>
John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill, which his Governor loves. He campaigned on Repeal &amp, Replace. Let Arizona down!
<|endoftext|>
Heading to Alabama now, big crowd!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to Doug Parker and American Airlines for all of the help you have given to the U.S. with Hurricane flights. Fantastic job!
<|endoftext|>
Will be in Alabama tonight. Luther Strange has gained mightily since my endorsement, but will be very close. He loves Alabama, and so do I!
<|endoftext|>
"The greatest influence over our election was the Fake News Media ""screaming"" for Crooked Hillary Clinton. Next, she was a bad candidate!"
<|endoftext|>
The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?
<|endoftext|>
Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!
<|endoftext|>
"Rand Paul, or whoever votes against Hcare Bill, will forever (future political campaigns) be known as ""the Republican who saved ObamaCare."""
<|endoftext|>
A big day for the U.S. at the United Nations!
<|endoftext|>
Senator Luther Strange has gone up a lot in the polls since I endorsed him a month ago. Now a close runoff. He will be great in D.C.
<|endoftext|>
Senator (Doctor) Bill Cassidy is a class act who really cares about people and their Health(care), he doesn't lie-just wants to help people!
<|endoftext|>
The NRA strongly endorses Luther Strange for Senator of Alabama.That means all gun owners should vote for Big Luther. He won't let you down!
<|endoftext|>
I would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions. It does! A great Bill. Repeal &amp, Replace.
<|endoftext|>
"Alabama is sooo lucky to have a candidate like ""Big"" Luther Strange. Smart, tough on crime, borders &amp, trade, loves Vets &amp, Military. Tuesday!"
<|endoftext|>
"Looking forward to Friday night in the Great State of Alabama. I am supporting ""Big"" Luther Strange because he was so loyal &amp, helpful to me!"
<|endoftext|>
I hope Republican Senators will vote for Graham-Cassidy and fulfill their promise to Repeal &amp, Replace ObamaCare. Money direct to States!
<|endoftext|>
Rand Paul is a friend of mine but he is such a negative force when it comes to fixing healthcare. Graham-Cassidy Bill is GREAT! Ends Ocare!
<|endoftext|>
After allowing North Korea to research and build Nukes while Secretary of State (Bill C also), Crooked Hillary now criticizes.
<|endoftext|>
Big meetings today at the United Nations. So many interesting leaders. America First will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
"I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night - the worst ever. Smartest people of them all are the ""DEPLORABLES."""
<|endoftext|>
A great and important day at the United Nations.Met with leaders of many nations who agree with much (or all) of what I stated in my speech!
<|endoftext|>
Puerto Rico being hit hard by new monster Hurricane. Be careful, our hearts are with you- will be there to help!
<|endoftext|>
God bless the people of Mexico City. We are with you and will be there for you.
<|endoftext|>
Big day at the United Nations - many good things, and some tricky ones, happening. We have a great team. Big speech at 10:00 A.M.
<|endoftext|>
Important meetings and calls scheduled for today. Military and economy are getting stronger by the day, and our enemies know it. #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!

<|endoftext|>
"I will be in Huntsville, Alabama, on Saturday night to support Luther Strange for Senate. ""Big Luther"" is a great guy who gets things done!"
<|endoftext|>
Attorney General Bill Shuette will be a fantastic Governor for the great State of Michigan. I am bringing back your jobs and Bill will help!

A great deal of good things happening for our country. Jobs and Stock Market at all time highs, and I believe will be getting even better!

CHAIN MIGRATION cannot be allowed to be part of any legislation on Immigration!
<|endoftext|>
ESPN is paying a really big price for its politics (and bad programming). People are dumping it in RECORD numbers. Apologize for untruth!
<|endoftext|>
We have made more progress in the last nine months against ISIS than the Obama Administration has made in 8 years.Must be proactive &amp, nasty!
<|endoftext|>
The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!
<|endoftext|>
Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner.The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off &amp, use better!

Another attack in London by a loser terrorist.These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive!
<|endoftext|>
With the ridiculous Filibuster Rule in the Senate, Republicans need 60 votes to pass legislation, rather than 51. Can't get votes, END NOW!
<|endoftext|>
...I told Republicans to approve healthcare fast or this would happen. But don't worry, I will veto because I love our country &amp, its people.
<|endoftext|>
Bernie Sanders is pushing hard for a single payer healthcare plan - a curse on the U.S. &amp, its people...
<|endoftext|>
Spoke to President of Mexico to give condolences on terrible earthquake. Unable to reach for 3 days b/c of his cell phone reception at site.
<|endoftext|>
Just left Florida for D.C. The people and spirit in THAT GREAT STATE is unbelievable. Damage horrific but will be better than ever!
<|endoftext|>
Am leaving now for Florida to see our GREAT first responders and to thank the U.S. Coast Guard, FEMA etc. A real disaster, much work to do!
<|endoftext|>
...They have been in our country for many years through no fault of their own - brought in by parents at young age. Plus BIG border security
<|endoftext|>
Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military? Really!.....
<|endoftext|>
The WALL, which is already under construction in the form of new renovation of old and existing fences and walls, will continue to be built.
<|endoftext|>
No deal was made last night on DACA. Massive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent. Would be subject to vote.
<|endoftext|>
"The ""deplorables"" came back to haunt Hillary.They expressed their feelings loud and clear. She spent big money but, in the end, had no game!"
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss. She lost the debates and lost her direction!
<|endoftext|>
China has a business tax rate of 15%. We should do everything possible to match them in order to win with our economy. Jobs and wages!
<|endoftext|>
With Irma and Harvey devastation, Tax Cuts and Tax Reform is needed more than ever before. Go Congress, go!
<|endoftext|>
I will be traveling to Florida tomorrow to meet with our great Coast Guard, FEMA and many of the brave first responders &amp, others.
<|endoftext|>
The approval process for the biggest Tax Cut &amp, Tax Reform package in the history of our country will soon begin. Move fast Congress!
<|endoftext|>
Heading back to Washington, D.C. Much will be accomplished this week on trade, the military and security!
<|endoftext|>
The devastation left by Hurricane Irma was far greater, at least in certain locations,than anyone thought - but amazing people working hard!
<|endoftext|>
Fascinating to watch people writing books and major articles about me and yet they know nothing about me &amp, have zero access. #FAKE NEWS!
<|endoftext|>
The U.S. Coast Guard, FEMA and all Federal and State brave people are ready. Here comes Irma. God bless everyone!
<|endoftext|>
Churches in Texas should be entitled to reimbursement from FEMA Relief Funds for helping victims of Hurricane Harvey (just like others).
<|endoftext|>
Republicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP. Don't wait until the end of September. Needed now more than ever. Hurry!
<|endoftext|>
...never allow the Republicans to pass even great legislation. 8 Dems control - will rarely get 60 (vs. 51) votes. It is a Repub Death Wish!
<|endoftext|>
Republicans, sorry, but I've been hearing about Repeal &amp, Replace for 7 years, didn't happen! Even worse, the Senate Filibuster Rule will....
<|endoftext|>
Our incredible U.S. Coast Guard saved more than 15,000 lives last week with Harvey. Irma could be even tougher. We love our Coast Guard!
<|endoftext|>
Hurricane Irma is of epic proportion, perhaps bigger than we have ever seen. Be safe and get out of its way,if possible. Federal G is ready!
<|endoftext|>
We will confront ANY challenge, no matter how strong the winds or high the water. I’m proud to stand with Presidents for #OneAmericaAppeal.
<|endoftext|>
For all of those (DACA) that are concerned about your status during the 6 month period, you have nothing to worry about - No action!
<|endoftext|>
Hurricane Irma is raging but we have great teams of talented and brave people already in place and ready to help. Be careful, be safe! #FEMA
<|endoftext|>
Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic!
<|endoftext|>
Watching Hurricane closely. My team, which has done, and is doing, such a good job in Texas, is already in Florida. No rest for the weary!
<|endoftext|>
Will be going to North Dakota today to discuss tax reform and tax cuts. We are the highest taxed nation in the world - that will change.
<|endoftext|>
Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can't, I will revisit this issue!
<|endoftext|>
I look forward to working w/ D's + R's in Congress to address immigration reform in a way that puts hardworking citizens of our country 1st.
<|endoftext|>
I am allowing Japan &amp, South Korea to buy a substantially increased amount of highly sophisticated military equipment from the United States.
<|endoftext|>
Congress, get ready to do your job - DACA!
<|endoftext|>
Big week coming up!
<|endoftext|>
The United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea.
<|endoftext|>
I will be meeting General Kelly, General Mattis and other military leaders at the White House to discuss North Korea. Thank you.
<|endoftext|>
South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!
<|endoftext|>
..North Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success.
<|endoftext|>
North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.....
<|endoftext|>
Remember, Sunday is National Prayer Day (by Presidential Proclamation)!
<|endoftext|>
Just got back to the White House from the Great States of Texas and Louisiana, where things are going well. Such cooperation &amp, coordination!
<|endoftext|>
The Manufacturing Index rose to 59%, the highest level since early 2011 - and we can do much better!
<|endoftext|>
I will be going to Texas and Louisiana tomorrow with First Lady. Great progress being made! Spending weekend working at White House.
<|endoftext|>
Stock Market up 5 months in a row!
<|endoftext|>
Texas is healing fast thanks to all of the great men &amp, women who have been working so hard. But still so much to do. Will be back tomorrow!
<|endoftext|>
...get things done at a record clip. Many big decisions to be made over the coming days and weeks. AMERICA FIRST!
<|endoftext|>
General John Kelly is doing a great job as Chief of Staff. I could not be happier or more impressed - and this Administration continues to..
<|endoftext|>
Wow, looks like James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over...and so much more. A rigged system!
<|endoftext|>
Texas is heeling fast thanks to all of the great men &amp, women who have been working so hard. But still, so much to do. Will be back tomorrow!
<|endoftext|>
Will be leaving for Missouri soon for a speech on tax cuts and tax reform - so badly needed!
<|endoftext|>
After reading the false reporting and even ferocious anger in some dying magazines, it makes me wonder, WHY? All I want to do is #MAGA!
<|endoftext|>
After witnessing first hand the horror &amp, devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey,my heart goes out even more so to the great people of Texas!
<|endoftext|>
The U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!
<|endoftext|>
Leaving now for Texas!
<|endoftext|>
HISTORIC rainfall in Houston, and all over Texas. Floods are unprecedented, and more rain coming. Spirit of the people is incredible.Thanks!
<|endoftext|>
Major rescue operations underway!
<|endoftext|>
Going to a Cabinet Meeting (tele-conference) at 11:00 A.M. on #Harvey. Even experts have said they've never seen one like this!
<|endoftext|>
We are in the NAFTA (worst trade deal ever made) renegotiation process with Mexico &amp, Canada.Both being very difficult,may have to terminate?
<|endoftext|>
With Mexico being one of the highest crime Nations in the world, we must have THE WALL. Mexico will pay for it through reimbursement/other.
<|endoftext|>
Wow - Now experts are calling #Harvey a once in 500 year flood! We have an all out effort going, and going well!
<|endoftext|>
I will also be going to a wonderful state, Missouri, that I won by a lot in '16. Dem C.M. is opposed to big tax cuts. Republican will win S!
<|endoftext|>
I will be going to Texas as soon as that trip can be made without causing disruption. The focus must be life and safety.
<|endoftext|>
Many people are now saying that this is the worst storm/hurricane they have ever seen. Good news is that we have great talent on the ground.
<|endoftext|>
Great coordination between agencies at all levels of government. Continuing rains and flash floods are being dealt with. Thousands rescued.
<|endoftext|>
Wonderful coordination between Federal, State and Local Governments in the Great State of Texas - TEAMWORK! Record setting rainfall.
<|endoftext|>
Closely monitoring #HurricaneHarvey from Camp David. We are leaving nothing to chance. City, State and Federal Govs. working great together!
<|endoftext|>
I am pleased to inform you that I have just granted a full Pardon to 85 year old American patriot Sheriff Joe Arpaio. He kept Arizona safe!
<|endoftext|>
At the request of the Governor of Texas, I have signed the Disaster Proclamation, which unleashes the full force of government help!
<|endoftext|>
Storm turned Hurricane is getting much bigger and more powerful than projected. Federal Government is on site and ready to respond. Be safe!
<|endoftext|>
Just arrived at Camp David, where I am monitoring the path and doings of Hurricane Harvey (as it strengthens to a Class 3). 125 MPH winds!
<|endoftext|>
Just arrived at Camp David where I am closely watching the path and doings of Hurricane Harvey, as it strengthens to a Category 3. BE SAFE!
<|endoftext|>
Strange statement by Bob Corker considering that he is constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in '18. Tennessee not happy!
<|endoftext|>
"Nick Adams, ""Retaking America""  ""Best things of this presidency aren't reported about. Convinced this will be perhaps best presidency ever."""
<|endoftext|>
Few, if any, Administrations have done more in just 7 months than the Trump A. Bills passed, regulations killed, border, military, ISIS, SC!
<|endoftext|>
General John Kelly is doing a fantastic job as Chief of Staff. There is tremendous spirit and talent in the W.H. Don't believe the Fake News
<|endoftext|>
If Senate Republicans don't get rid of the Filibuster Rule and go to a 51% majority, few bills will be passed. 8 Dems control the Senate!
<|endoftext|>
The only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that, after hearing Repeal &amp, Replace for 7 years, he failed!That should NEVER have happened!
<|endoftext|>
James Clapper, who famously got caught lying to Congress, is now an authority on Donald Trump. Will he show you his beautiful letter to me?
<|endoftext|>
..(enthusiastic, dynamic and fun) and the American Legion - V.A. (respectful and strong). Too bad the Dems have no one who can change tones!
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
...didn't do it so now we have a big deal with Dems holding them up (as usual) on Debt Ceiling approval. Could have been so easy-now a mess!
<|endoftext|>
I requested that Mitch M &amp, Paul R tie the Debt Ceiling legislation into the popular V.A. Bill (which just passed) for easy approval. They...
<|endoftext|>
If Republican Senate doesn't get rid of the Filibuster Rule &amp, go to a simple majority, which the Dems would do, they are just wasting time!
<|endoftext|>
Last night in Phoenix I read the things from my statements on Charlottesville that the Fake News Media didn't cover fairly. People got it!
<|endoftext|>
Phoenix crowd last night was amazing - a packed house. I love the Great State of Arizona. Not a fan of Jeff Flake, weak on crime &amp, border!
<|endoftext|>
Heading back to Washington after working hard and watching some of the worst and most dishonest Fake News reporting I have ever seen!
<|endoftext|>
I want to applaud the many protestors in Boston who are speaking out against bigotry and hate. Our country will soon come together as one!
<|endoftext|>
Our great country has been divided for decades. Sometimes you need protest in order to heal, &amp, we will heal, &amp, be stronger than ever before!
<|endoftext|>
Our great country has been divided for decades. Sometimes you need protest in order to heel, &amp, we will heel, &amp, be stronger than ever before!
<|endoftext|>
Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston. Police are looking tough and smart! Thank you.
<|endoftext|>
Important day spent at Camp David with our very talented Generals and military leaders. Many decisions made, including on Afghanistan.
<|endoftext|>
I want to thank Steve Bannon for his service. He came to the campaign during my run against Crooked Hillary Clinton - it was great! Thanks S
<|endoftext|>
Heading to Camp David for major meeting on National Security, the Border and the Military (which we are rapidly building to strongest ever).
<|endoftext|>
Radical Islamic Terrorism must be stopped by whatever means necessary! The courts must give us back our protective rights. Have to be tough!
<|endoftext|>
The Obstructionist Democrats make Security for our country very difficult. They use the courts and associated delay at all times. Must stop!
<|endoftext|>
Homeland Security and law enforcement are on alert &amp, closely watching for any sign of trouble. Our borders are far tougher than ever before!
<|endoftext|>
Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!
<|endoftext|>
The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough &amp, strong, we love you!
<|endoftext|>
...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!
<|endoftext|>
...can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also...
<|endoftext|>
Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You.....
<|endoftext|>
Many meetings today in Bedminster including with Secretary Linda M and Small Business. Job numbers are looking great!
<|endoftext|>
Great to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake Jeff Flake, who is WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate. He's toxic!
<|endoftext|>
The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is. They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry etc. Shame!
<|endoftext|>
...and people like Ms. Heyer. Such a disgusting lie. He just can't forget his election trouncing.The people of South Carolina will remember!
<|endoftext|>
Heading to Washington this morning. Much work to do. Focus on trade and military. #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis &amp, white supremacists......
<|endoftext|>
Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council &amp, Strategy &amp, Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!
<|endoftext|>
Memorial service today for beautiful and incredible Heather Heyer, a truly special young woman. She will be long remembered by all!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, Senator Luther Strange picked up a lot of additional support since my endorsement. Now in September runoff. Strong on Wall &amp, Crime!
<|endoftext|>
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Kim Jong Un of North Korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision. The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!
<|endoftext|>
Congratulation to Roy Moore and Luther Strange for being the final two and heading into a September runoff in Alabama. Exciting race!
<|endoftext|>
Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost!
<|endoftext|>
For every CEO that drops out of the Manufacturing Council, I have many to take their place. Grandstanders should not have gone on. JOBS!
<|endoftext|>
Big day in Alabama. Vote for Luther Strange, he will be great!
<|endoftext|>
Feels good to be home after seven months, but the White House is very special, there is no place like it... and the U.S. is really my home!
<|endoftext|>
Made additional remarks on Charlottesville and realize once again that the #Fake News Media will never be satisfied...truly bad people!
<|endoftext|>
Leaving for New York City and meetings on military purchases and trade.
<|endoftext|>
Big day in Washington, D.C., even though White House &amp, Oval Office are being renovated. Great trade deals coming for American workers!
<|endoftext|>
Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!
<|endoftext|>
The Obstructionist Democrats have given us (or not fixed) some of the worst trade deals in World History. I am changing that fast!
<|endoftext|>
Luther Strange of the Great State of Alabama has my endorsement. He is strong on Border &amp, Wall, the military, tax cuts &amp, law enforcement.
<|endoftext|>
Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today, and best regards to all of those injured, in Charlottesville, Virginia. So sad!
<|endoftext|>
Deepest condolences to the families &amp, fellow officers of the VA State Police who died today. You're all among the best this nation produces.
<|endoftext|>
Am in Bedminster for meetings &amp, press conference on V.A. &amp, all that we have done, and are doing, to make it better-but Charlottesville sad!
<|endoftext|>
We ALL must be united &amp, condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!
<|endoftext|>
Military solutions are now fully in place,locked and loaded,should North Korea act unwisely.  Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path!
<|endoftext|>
Mitch, get back to work and put Repeal &amp, Replace, Tax Reform &amp, Cuts and a great Infrastructure Bill on my desk for signing. You can do it!
<|endoftext|>
Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal &amp, Replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done. Must Repeal &amp, Replace ObamaCare!
<|endoftext|>
"Senator Mitch McConnell said I had ""excessive expectations,"" but I don't think so. After 7 years of hearing Repeal &amp, Replace, why not done?"
<|endoftext|>
...Hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!
<|endoftext|>
My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before....
<|endoftext|>
Senator Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama. He has my complete and total endorsement!
<|endoftext|>
After 200 days, rarely has any Administration achieved what we have achieved..not even close! Don't believe the Fake News Suppression Polls!
<|endoftext|>
E-mails show that the AmazonWashingtonPost and the FailingNewYorkTimes were reluctant to cover the Clinton/Lynch secret meeting in plane.
<|endoftext|>
After many years of failure,countries are coming together to  finally address the dangers posed by North Korea. We must be tough &amp, decisive!
<|endoftext|>
I will be holding a major briefing on the Opioid crisis, a major problem for our country, today at 3:00 P.M. in Bedminster, N.J.
<|endoftext|>
I think Senator Blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in Vietnam, where he lied about his service, so he can at least say he was there
<|endoftext|>
How much longer will the failing nytimes, with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources), remain in business?
<|endoftext|>
The Fake News Media will not talk about the importance of the United Nations Security Council's 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on N. Korea!
<|endoftext|>
...conquests, how brave he was, and it was all a lie. He cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child. Now he judges collusion?
<|endoftext|>
Never in U.S.history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like Senator Richard Blumenthal. He told stories about his Vietnam battles and....
<|endoftext|>
Interesting to watch Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut talking about hoax Russian collusion when he was a  phony Vietnam con artist!
<|endoftext|>
Working hard from New Jersey while White House goes through long planned renovation. Going to New York next week for more meetings.
<|endoftext|>
Hard to believe that with 24/7 #Fake News on CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, NYTIMES &amp, WAPO, the Trump base is getting stronger!
<|endoftext|>
... Supreme Court pick, economic enthusiasm, deregulation &amp, so much more have driven the Trump base even closer together. Will never change!
<|endoftext|>
...and West Virginia. The fact is the Fake News Russian collusion story, record Stock Market, border security, military strength, jobs.....
<|endoftext|>
The Trump base is far bigger &amp,  stronger than ever before (despite some phony Fake News polling). Look at rallies in Penn, Iowa, Ohio.......
<|endoftext|>
Just completed call with President Moon of South Korea. Very happy and impressed with 15-0 United Nations vote on North Korea sanctions.
<|endoftext|>
The Fake News refuses to report the success of the first 6 months: S.C., surging economy &amp, jobs,border &amp, military security,ISIS &amp, MS-13 etc.
<|endoftext|>
United Nations Resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever on North Korea. Over one billion dollars in cost to N.K.
<|endoftext|>
After many years of LEAKS going on in Washington, it is great to see the A.G. taking action! For National Security, the tougher the better!
<|endoftext|>
The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact!
<|endoftext|>
Working in Bedminster, N.J., as long planned construction is being done at the White House. This is not a vacation - meetings and calls!
<|endoftext|>
Excellent Jobs Numbers just released - and I have only just begun. Many job stifling regulations continue to fall. Movement back to USA!
<|endoftext|>
West Virginia was incredible last night. Crowds and enthusiasm were beyond, GDP at 3%, wow!Dem Governor became a Republican last night.
<|endoftext|>
"Consumer confidence is at a 16 year high....and for good reason. Much more regulation ""busting"" to come. Working hard on tax cuts &amp, reform!"
<|endoftext|>
....and don't forget that Foxconn will be spending up to 10 billion dollars on a top of the line plant/plants in Wisconsin.
<|endoftext|>
Toyota &amp, Mazda to build a new $1.6B plant here in the U.S.A. and create 4K new American jobs. A great investment in American manufacturing!
<|endoftext|>
Just arrived in West Virginia for a MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN rally in Huntington at 7:00pmE. Massive crowd expected - tune in! #MAGA🇺🇸
<|endoftext|>
Our relationship with Russia is at an all-time &amp, very dangerous  low. You can thank Congress, the same people that can't even give us HCare!
<|endoftext|>
I am continuing to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations. Much work left to do but effect will be great! Business &amp, jobs will grow.
<|endoftext|>
Business is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels. Stock Market at an all-time high. That doesn't just happen!
<|endoftext|>
I love the White House, one of the most beautiful buildings (homes) I have ever seen. But Fake News said I called it a dump - TOTALLY UNTRUE
<|endoftext|>
Only the Fake News Media and Trump enemies want me to stop using Social Media (110 million people). Only way for me to get the truth out!
<|endoftext|>
Stock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!
<|endoftext|>
A great day at the White House!
<|endoftext|>
Highest Stock Market EVER, best economic numbers in years, unemployment lowest in 17 years, wages raising, border secure, S.C.: No WH chaos!
<|endoftext|>
If ObamaCare is hurting people, &amp, it is, why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies &amp, why should Congress not be paying what public pays?
<|endoftext|>
Don't give up Republican Senators, the World is watching: Repeal &amp, Replace...and go to 51 votes (nuke option), get Cross State Lines &amp, more.
<|endoftext|>
...they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!
<|endoftext|>
I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet...
<|endoftext|>
"I love reading about all of the ""geniuses"" who were so instrumental in my election success. Problem is, most don't exist. #Fake News! MAGA"
<|endoftext|>
Unless the Republican Senators are total quitters, Repeal &amp, Replace is not dead! Demand another vote before voting on any other bill!
<|endoftext|>
If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon!
<|endoftext|>
"After seven years of ""talking"" Repeal &amp, Replace, the people of our great country are still being forced to live with imploding ObamaCare!"
<|endoftext|>
If the Senate Democrats ever got the chance, they would switch to a 51 majority vote in first minute. They are laughing at R's. MAKE CHANGE!
<|endoftext|>
....8 Dems totally control the U.S. Senate. Many great Republican bills will never pass, like Kate's Law and complete Healthcare. Get smart!
<|endoftext|>
Republicans in the Senate will NEVER win if they don't go to a 51 vote majority NOW. They look like fools and are just wasting time......
<|endoftext|>
The very outdated filibuster rule must go. Budget reconciliation is killing R's in Senate. Mitch M, go to 51 Votes NOW and WIN. IT'S TIME!
<|endoftext|>
Republican Senate must get rid of 60 vote NOW! It is killing the R Party, allows 8 Dems to control country. 200 Bills sit in Senate. A JOKE!
<|endoftext|>
I would like to thank Reince Priebus for his service and dedication to his country. We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him!
<|endoftext|>
...and a Great Leader. John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my Administration
<|endoftext|>
I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. He is a Great American....
<|endoftext|>
...Even though parts of healthcare could pass at 51, some really good things need 60. So many great future bills &amp, budgets need 60 votes....
<|endoftext|>
If Republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the Senate, they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority, not senseless 60...
<|endoftext|>
3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!
<|endoftext|>
Go Republican Senators, Go! Get there after waiting for 7 years. Give America great healthcare!
<|endoftext|>
Big progress being made in ridding our country of MS-13 gang members and gang members in general. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
"""One of the things that has been lost in the politics of this situation is that the Russians collected and spread negative information....."
<|endoftext|>
Come on Republican Senators, you can do it on Healthcare. After 7 years, this is your chance to shine! Don't let the American people down!
<|endoftext|>
...big dollars ($700,000) for his wife's political run from Hillary Clinton and her representatives. Drain the Swamp!
<|endoftext|>
Why didn't A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation but got....
<|endoftext|>
....victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you
<|endoftext|>
....Transgender individuals to  serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming.....
<|endoftext|>
After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow......
<|endoftext|>
The crowd in Ohio was amazing last night - broke all records. We all had a great time in a great State. Will be back soon!
<|endoftext|>
Will be traveling to the Great State of Ohio tonight. Big crowd expected. See you there!
<|endoftext|>
This will be a very interesting day for HealthCare.The Dems are obstructionists but the Republicans can have a great victory for the people!
<|endoftext|>
Working on major Trade Deal with the United Kingdom. Could be very big &amp, exciting. JOBS! The E.U. is very protectionist with the U.S. STOP!
<|endoftext|>
Jared Kushner did very well yesterday in proving he did not collude with the Russians. Witch Hunt. Next up, 11 year old Barron Trump!
<|endoftext|>
So great that John McCain is coming back to vote. Brave - American hero! Thank you John.
<|endoftext|>
ObamaCare is torturing the American People.The Democrats have fooled the people long enough. Repeal or Repeal &amp, Replace! I have pen in hand.
<|endoftext|>
Big day for HealthCare. After 7 years of talking, we will soon see whether or not Republicans are willing to step up to the plate!
<|endoftext|>
Problem is that the acting head of the FBI &amp, the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!
<|endoftext|>
Sean Spicer is a wonderful person who took tremendous abuse from the Fake News Media - but his future is bright!
<|endoftext|>
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails &amp, DNC server) &amp, Intel leakers!
<|endoftext|>
Is Fake News Washington Post being used as a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly?
<|endoftext|>
The Amazon Washington Post fabricated the facts on my ending massive, dangerous, and wasteful payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad.....
<|endoftext|>
Republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on Repeal &amp, Replace after years of talking &amp, campaigning on it.
<|endoftext|>
"Sleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into ""Russia,"" spends all of his time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse!"
<|endoftext|>
So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes &amp, Russia relations?
<|endoftext|>
"After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found, Chuck Schumer just stated that ""Democrats should blame ourselves,not Russia."""
<|endoftext|>
Drain the Swamp should be changed to Drain the Sewer - it's actually much worse than anyone ever thought, and it begins with the Fake News!
<|endoftext|>
If Republicans don't Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare, the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand!
<|endoftext|>
It's hard to read the Failing New York Times or the Amazon Washington Post because every story/opinion, even if should be positive, is bad!
<|endoftext|>
It's very sad that Republicans, even some that were carried over the line on my back, do very little to protect their President.
<|endoftext|>
As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!
<|endoftext|>
Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent. That's politics!
<|endoftext|>
ObamaCare is dead and the Democrats are obstructionists, no ideas or votes, only obstruction. It is solely up to the 52 Republican Senators!
<|endoftext|>
The Republican Senators must step up to the plate and, after 7 years, vote to Repeal and Replace. Next, Tax Reform and Infrastructure. WIN!
<|endoftext|>
In all fairness to Anthony Scaramucci, he wanted to endorse me 1st, before the Republican Primaries started, but didn't think I was running!
<|endoftext|>
My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media &amp, authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (&amp, acid washed) her 33,000 e-mails!
<|endoftext|>
...What about all of the Clinton ties to Russia, including Podesta Company, Uranium deal, Russian Reset, big dollar speeches etc.
<|endoftext|>
So many people are asking why isn't the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 e-mails deleted?
<|endoftext|>
While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS
<|endoftext|>
This morning I will be going to the Commissioning Ceremony for the largest aircraft carrier in the world, The Gerald R. Ford.  Norfolk, Va.
<|endoftext|>
The Failing New York Times foiled U.S. attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist,Al-Baghdadi.Their sick agenda over National Security
<|endoftext|>
A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post,this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions.These illegal leaks, like Comey's, must stop!
<|endoftext|>
The Republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is, &amp, it will get even better at lunchtime.The Dems scream death as OCare dies!
<|endoftext|>
I will be having lunch at the White House today with Republican Senators concerning healthcare. They MUST keep their promise to America!
<|endoftext|>
The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest! Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister!
<|endoftext|>
"Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is ""sick."" All G 20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!"
<|endoftext|>
The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes. Even parts of full Repeal need 60. 8 Dems control Senate. Crazy!
<|endoftext|>
With only a very small majority, the Republicans in the House &amp, Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct, no votes!
<|endoftext|>
As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!
<|endoftext|>
We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal, terrific &amp, worked really hard. We will return!
<|endoftext|>
Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now &amp, work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!
<|endoftext|>
The ABC/Washington Post Poll, even though almost 40% is not bad at this time, was just about the most inaccurate poll around election time!
<|endoftext|>
With all of its phony unnamed sources &amp, highly slanted &amp, even fraudulent reporting, #Fake News is DISTORTING DEMOCRACY in our country!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to former campaign adviser Michael Caputo for saying so powerfully that there was no Russian collusion in our winning campaign.
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to all of the supporters, who far out-numbered the protesters, yesterday at the Women's U.S. Open. Very cool!
<|endoftext|>
HillaryClinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate &amp, delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?
<|endoftext|>
Just got to the #USWomensOpen in Bedminster, New Jersey. People are really happy with record high stock market - up over 17% since election!
<|endoftext|>
Stock Market hit another all-time high yesterday - despite the Russian hoax story! Also, jobs numbers are starting to look very good!
<|endoftext|>
Stock Market at new all-time high! Working on new trade deals that will be great for U.S. and its workers!
<|endoftext|>
Left Paris for U.S.A. Will be heading to New Jersey and attending the#USWomensOpen, their most important tournament, this afternoon.
<|endoftext|>
After all of these years of suffering thru ObamaCare, Republican Senators must come through as they have promised!
<|endoftext|>
Republicans Senators are working hard to get their failed ObamaCare replacement approved. I will be at my desk, pen in hand!
<|endoftext|>
The W.H. is functioning perfectly, focused on HealthCare, Tax Cuts/Reform &amp, many other things. I have very little time for watching T.V.
<|endoftext|>
Why aren't the same standards placed on the Democrats. Look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with. Disgraceful!
<|endoftext|>
ISIS is on the run &amp, will soon be wiped out of Syria &amp, Iraq, illegal border crossings are way down (75%) &amp, MS 13 gangs are being removed.
<|endoftext|>
"Remember, when you hear the words ""sources say"" from the Fake Media, often times those sources are made up and do not exist."
<|endoftext|>
My son Donald did a good job last night. He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!
<|endoftext|>
Marine Plane crash in Mississippi is heartbreaking. Melania and I send our deepest condolences to all!
<|endoftext|>
Working hard to get the Olympics for the United States (L.A.). Stay tuned!
<|endoftext|>
The Senate Democrats have only confirmed 48 of 197 Presidential Nominees. They  can't win so all they do is slow things down &amp, obstruct!
<|endoftext|>
If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her mother,as her mother gave our country away, the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!
<|endoftext|>
When I left Conference Room for short meetings with Japan and other countries, I asked Ivanka to hold seat. Very standard. Angela M agrees!
<|endoftext|>
I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!
<|endoftext|>
James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal!
<|endoftext|>
The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit  doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't-but a ceasefire can,&amp, did!
<|endoftext|>
Syrian ceasefire seems to be holding. Many lives can be saved. Came out of meeting. Good!
<|endoftext|>
"For years, even as a ""civilian,"" I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare. Now they finally have their chance!"
<|endoftext|>
Sanctions were not discussed at my meeting with President Putin. Nothing will be done until the Ukrainian &amp, Syrian problems are solved!
<|endoftext|>
...have it. Fake News said 17 intel agencies when actually 4 (had to apologize). Why did Obama do NOTHING when he had info before election?
<|endoftext|>
...and safe. Questions were asked about why the CIA &amp, FBI had to ask the DNC 13 times for their SERVER, and were rejected, still don't....
<|endoftext|>
Putin &amp, I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit    so that election hacking, &amp, many other negative things, will be guarded..
<|endoftext|>
...We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!
<|endoftext|>
I strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it. I've already given my opinion.....
<|endoftext|>
The G 20 Summit was a great success for the U.S. - Explained that the U.S. must fix the many bad trade deals it has made. Will get done!
<|endoftext|>
Leaving Hamburg for Washington, D.C. and the WH. Just left China’s President Xi where we had an excellent meeting on trade &amp, North Korea.
<|endoftext|>
The #G20Summit was a wonderful success and carried out beautifully by Chancellor Angela Merkel. Thank you!
<|endoftext|>
I will represent our country well and fight for its interests! Fake News Media will never cover me accurately but who cares! We will #MAGA!
<|endoftext|>
I look forward to all meetings today with world leaders, including my meeting with Vladimir Putin. Much to discuss.#G20Summit #USA🇺🇸
<|endoftext|>
Everyone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA. Disgraceful!
<|endoftext|>
After Poland had a great meeting with Chancellor Merkel and then with PM Shinzō Abe of Japan &amp, President Moon of South Korea.
<|endoftext|>
My experience yesterday in Poland was a great one. Thank you to everyone, including the haters, for the great reviews of the speech!
<|endoftext|>
Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!
<|endoftext|>
The United States made some of the worst Trade Deals in world history.Why should we continue these deals with countries that do not help us?
<|endoftext|>
Getting ready to leave for Poland, after which I will travel to Germany for the G-20. Will be back on Saturday.
<|endoftext|>
Gas prices are the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years! I would like to see them go even lower.
<|endoftext|>
Getting ready to celebrate the 4th of July with a big crowd at the White House. Happy 4th to everyone. Our country will grow and prosper!
<|endoftext|>
....and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!
<|endoftext|>
North Korea has just launched another missile. Does this guy have anything better to do with his life? Hard to believe that South Korea.....
<|endoftext|>
Dow hit a new intraday all-time high! I wonder whether or not the Fake News Media will so report?
<|endoftext|>
Really great numbers on jobs &amp, the economy! Things are starting to kick in now, and we have just begun! Don't like steel &amp, aluminum dumping!
<|endoftext|>
If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so.
<|endoftext|>
At some point the Fake News will be forced to discuss our great jobs numbers, strong economy, success with ISIS, the border &amp, so much else!
<|endoftext|>
Will be speaking with Italy this morning!
<|endoftext|>
Spoke yesterday with the King of Saudi Arabia about peace in the Middle-East. Interesting things are happening!
<|endoftext|>
Will be speaking with Germany and France this morning.
<|endoftext|>
Stock Market at all time high, unemployment at lowest level in years (wages will start going up) and our base has never been stronger!
<|endoftext|>
My use of social media is not Presidential - it’s MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL. Make America Great Again!
<|endoftext|>
I am thinking about changing the name #FakeNews CNN to #FraudNewsCNN!
<|endoftext|>
....the 2016 election with interviews, speeches and social media. I had to beat #FakeNews, and did. We will continue to WIN!
<|endoftext|>
The FAKE &amp, FRAUDULENT NEWS MEDIA is working hard to convince Republicans and others I should not use social media - but remember, I won....
<|endoftext|>
Crazy Joe Scarborough and dumb as a rock Mika are not bad people, but their low rated show is dominated by their NBC bosses. Too bad!
<|endoftext|>
Numerous states are refusing to give information to the very distinguished VOTER FRAUD PANEL. What are they trying to hide?
<|endoftext|>
Crime and killings in Chicago have reached such epidemic proportions that I am sending in Federal help. 1714 shootings in Chicago this year!
<|endoftext|>
If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!
<|endoftext|>
Just finished a very good meeting with the President of South Korea. Many subjects discussed including North Korea and new trade deal!
<|endoftext|>
Good news out of the House with the passing of 'No Sanctuary for Criminals Act.' Hopefully Senate will follow.
<|endoftext|>
Good news, House just passed #KatesLaw. Hopefully Senate will follow.
<|endoftext|>
...to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!
<|endoftext|>
New Sugar deal negotiated with Mexico is a very good one for both Mexico and the U.S. Had no deal for many years which hurt U.S. badly.
<|endoftext|>
The #AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS!
<|endoftext|>
Some of the Fake News Media likes to say that I am not totally engaged in healthcare. Wrong, I know the subject well &amp, want victory for U.S.
<|endoftext|>
Karen Handel's opponent in #GA06 can't even vote in the district he wants to represent....
<|endoftext|>
I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare. They really want to get it right, unlike OCare!
<|endoftext|>
With ZERO Democrats to help, and a failed, expensive and dangerous ObamaCare as the Dems legacy, the Republican Senators are working hard!
<|endoftext|>
Fake News CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories. Ratings way down!
<|endoftext|>
"Wow, CNN had to retract big story on ""Russia,"" with 3 employees forced to resign. What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS!"
<|endoftext|>
Great day for America's future Security and Safety, courtesy of the U.S. Supreme Court. I will keep fighting for the American people, &amp, WIN!
<|endoftext|>
Very grateful for the 9-O decision from the U. S. Supreme Court. We must keep America SAFE!
<|endoftext|>
Republican Senators are working very hard to get there, with no help from the Democrats. Not easy! Perhaps just let OCare crash &amp, burn!
<|endoftext|>
"..under a magnifying glass, they have zero ""tapes"" of T people colluding. There is no collusion &amp, no obstruction. I should be given apology!"
<|endoftext|>
The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia...
<|endoftext|>
"...and did not want to ""rock the boat."" He didn't ""choke,"" he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good."
<|endoftext|>
The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS, they have no policies or ideas. All they do is delay and complain.They own ObamaCare!
<|endoftext|>
Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie!
<|endoftext|>
I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer!
<|endoftext|>
"Obama Administration official said they ""choked"" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?"
<|endoftext|>
Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling, why no action? Focus on them, not T!
<|endoftext|>
Democrats slam GOP healthcare proposal as Obamacare premiums &amp, deductibles increase by over 100%. Remember keep your doctor, keep your plan?
<|endoftext|>
Just out: The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?
<|endoftext|>
I've helped pass and signed 38 Legislative Bills, mostly with no Democratic support, and gotten rid of massive amounts of regulations. Nice!
<|endoftext|>
I am very supportive of the Senate #HealthcareBill. Look forward to making it really special! Remember, ObamaCare is dead.
<|endoftext|>
Mexico was just ranked the second deadliest country in the world, after only Syria. Drug trade is largely the cause. We will BUILD THE WALL!
<|endoftext|>
"...whether there are ""tapes"" or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings."
<|endoftext|>
With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea...
<|endoftext|>
I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out. That would be very bad for the Republican Party - and please let Cryin' Chuck stay!
<|endoftext|>
...Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI, and still hasn't? It's all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!
<|endoftext|>
...Why did Democratic National Committee turn down the DHS offer to protect against hacks (long prior to election). It's all a big Dem HOAX!
<|endoftext|>
By the way, if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election, it all took place during the Obama Admin. Why didn't they stop them?
<|endoftext|>
Former Homeland Security Advisor Jeh Johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between Trump &amp, Russia.
<|endoftext|>
Just landed in Iowa. See everyone soon! #MAGA🇺🇸
<|endoftext|>
Democrats would do much better as a party if they got together with Republicans on Healthcare,Tax Cuts,Security. Obstruction doesn't work!
<|endoftext|>
Well, the Special Elections are over and those that want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN are 5 and O! All the Fake News, all the money spent = 0
<|endoftext|>
Ralph Norman ran a fantastic race to win in the Great State of South Carolina's 5th District. We are all honored by your success tonight!
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations to Karen Handel on her big win in Georgia 6th. Fantastic job, we are all very proud of you!
<|endoftext|>
Things are looking great for Karen H!
<|endoftext|>
While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi &amp, China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!
<|endoftext|>
KAREN HANDEL FOR CONGRESS. She will fight for lower taxes, great healthcare strong security-a hard worker who will never give up! VOTE TODAY
<|endoftext|>
Democrat Jon Ossoff, who wants to raise your taxes to the highest level and is weak on crime and security, doesn't even live in district.
<|endoftext|>
"Big day tomorrow in Georgia and South Carolina. ObamaCare is dead. Dems want to raise taxes big! They can only obstruct, no ideas. Vote ""R"""
<|endoftext|>
....because he doesn't even live there! He wants to raise taxes and kill healthcare. On Tuesday, #VoteKarenHandel.
<|endoftext|>
....because he doesn't live there! He wants to raise taxes &amp, kill healthcare. On Tuesday, #VoteKarenHandel.

Ralph Norman, who is running for Congress in SC's 5th District, will be a fantastic help to me in cutting taxes, and....

<|endoftext|>
Camp David is a very special place. An honor to have spent the weekend there. Military runs it so well and are so proud of what they do!
<|endoftext|>
The new Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election, just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating.That's higher than O's #'s!
<|endoftext|>
...massive regulation cuts, 36 new legislative bills signed, great new S.C.Justice, and Infrastructure, Healthcare and Tax Cuts in works!
<|endoftext|>
The MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN agenda is doing very well despite the distraction of the Witch Hunt. Many new jobs, high business enthusiasm,..
<|endoftext|>
Back from Miami where my Cuban/American friends are very happy with what I signed today. Another campaign promise that I did not forget!
<|endoftext|>
I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt
<|endoftext|>
Despite the phony Witch Hunt going on in America, the economic &amp, jobs numbers are great. Regulations way down, jobs and enthusiasm way up!
<|endoftext|>
The Fake News Media hates when I use what has turned out to be my very powerful Social Media - over 100 million people! I can go around them
<|endoftext|>
"After 7 months of investigations &amp, committee hearings about my ""collusion with the Russians,""  nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad!"
<|endoftext|>
Crooked H destroyed phones w/ hammer, 'bleached' emails, &amp, had husband meet w/AG days before she was cleared- &amp, they talk about obstruction?
<|endoftext|>
Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at, but my non-dealings are?
<|endoftext|>
You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people!  #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice
<|endoftext|>
Just left hospital. Rep. Steve Scalise, one of the truly great people, is in very tough shape - but he is a real fighter. Pray for Steve!
<|endoftext|>
Happy birthday to U.S. ARMY and our soldiers. Thank you for your bravery, sacrifices, &amp, dedication. Proud to be your Commander-in-Chief!
<|endoftext|>
Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, a true friend and patriot, was badly injured but will fully recover. Our thoughts and prayers are with him.
<|endoftext|>
Just got back from Wisconsin. Great day, great people!
<|endoftext|>
2 million more people just dropped out of ObamaCare. It is in a death spiral. Obstructionist Democrats gave up, have no answer = resist!
<|endoftext|>
Heading to the Great State of Wisconsin to talk about JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Big progress being made as the Real News is reporting.
<|endoftext|>
Fake News is at an all time high. Where is their apology to me for all of the incorrect stories???
<|endoftext|>
A.G. Lynch made law enforcement decisions for political purposes...gave Hillary Clinton a free pass and protection. Totally illegal!
<|endoftext|>
Well, as predicted, the 9th Circuit did it again - Ruled against the TRAVEL BAN at such a dangerous time in the history of our country. S.C.
<|endoftext|>
The Fake News Media has never been so wrong or so dirty. Purposely incorrect stories and phony sources to meet their agenda of hate. Sad!
<|endoftext|>
Great numbers on the economy. All of our work, including the passage of many bills &amp, regulation killing Executive Orders, now kicking in!
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats have no message,  not on economics, not on taxes,  not on jobs, not on failing #Obamacare. They are only OBSTRUCTIONISTS!
<|endoftext|>
I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible. Totally illegal? Very 'cowardly!'
<|endoftext|>
...way up. Regulations way down. 600,000+ new jobs added. Unemployment down to 4.3%. Business and economic enthusiasm way up- record levels!
<|endoftext|>
The #FakeNews MSM doesn't report the great economic news since Election Day. #DOW up 16%. #NASDAQ up 19.5%. Drilling &amp, energy sector...
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations to Jeb Hensarling &amp, Republicans on successful House vote to repeal major parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law. GROWTH!
<|endoftext|>
Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication...and WOW, Comey is a leaker!
<|endoftext|>
Getting ready to leave for Cincinnati, in the GREAT STATE of OHIO, to meet with ObamaCare victims and talk Healthcare &amp, also Infrastructure!
<|endoftext|>
I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray, a man of impeccable credentials, to be the new Director of the FBI. Details to follow.
<|endoftext|>
Senate passed the VA Accountability Act. The House should get this bill to my desk ASAP! We can’t tolerate substandard care for our vets.
<|endoftext|>
...extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!
<|endoftext|>
So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding...
<|endoftext|>
Sorry folks, but if I would have relied on the Fake News of CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, washpost or nytimes, I would have had ZERO chance winning WH
<|endoftext|>
During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!
<|endoftext|>
The FAKE MSM is working so hard trying to get me not to use Social Media. They hate that I can get the honest and unfiltered message out.
<|endoftext|>
Big meeting today with Republican leadership concerning Tax Cuts and Healthcare. We are all pushing hard - must get it right!
<|endoftext|>
That's right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won't help us protect our people!
<|endoftext|>
"Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his ""no reason to be alarmed"" statement. MSM is working hard to sell it!"
<|endoftext|>
In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political!
<|endoftext|>
The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - &amp, seek much tougher version!
<|endoftext|>
The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.
<|endoftext|>
People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!
<|endoftext|>
Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck!
<|endoftext|>
"At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ""no reason to be alarmed!"""
<|endoftext|>
We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don't get smart it will only get worse
<|endoftext|>
Whatever the United States can do to help out in London and the U. K., we will be there - WE ARE WITH YOU. GOD BLESS!
<|endoftext|>
We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!
<|endoftext|>
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
"The big story is the ""unmasking and surveillance"" of people that took place during the Obama Administration."
<|endoftext|>
I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord, Thursday at 3:00 P.M.  The White House Rose Garden.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook &amp, even Dems &amp, DNC.
<|endoftext|>
I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Hopefully Republican Senators, good people all, can quickly get together and pass a new (repeal &amp, replace) HEALTHCARE bill. Add saved $'s.
<|endoftext|>
Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!

"...case against him &amp, now wants to clear his name by showing ""the false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan..."" Witch Hunt!"
<|endoftext|>
So now it is reported that the Democrats, who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia, don't want him to testify. He blows away their....
<|endoftext|>
"Who can figure out the true meaning of ""covfefe"" ???  Enjoy!"
<|endoftext|>
Despite the constant negative press covfefe
<|endoftext|>
The U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes, immediately, and get Healthcare and TAX CUTS approved, fast and easy. Dems would do it, no doubt!
<|endoftext|>
Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. &amp, how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.
<|endoftext|>
We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO &amp, military. Very bad for U.S. This will change
<|endoftext|>
I look forward to paying my respects to our brave men and women on this Memorial Day at Arlington National Cemetery later this morning.
<|endoftext|>
Today we remember the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in serving. Thank you, God bless your families &amp, God bless the USA!
<|endoftext|>
North Korea has shown great disrespect for their neighbor, China, by shooting off yet another ballistic missile...but China is trying hard!
<|endoftext|>
Honoring the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to America. Home of the free, because of the brave. #MemorialDay🇺🇸
<|endoftext|>
The Fake News Media works hard at disparaging &amp, demeaning my use of social media because they don't want America to hear the real story!
<|endoftext|>
The massive TAX CUTS/REFORM that I have submitted is moving along in the process very well, actually ahead of schedule. Big benefits to all!
<|endoftext|>
I suggest that we add more dollars to Healthcare and make it the best anywhere. ObamaCare is dead - the Republicans will do much better!
<|endoftext|>
British Prime Minister May was very angry that the info the U.K. gave to U.S. about Manchester was leaked. Gave me full details!
<|endoftext|>
Does anyone notice how the Montana Congressional race was such a big deal to Dems &amp, Fake News until the Republican won? V was poorly covered
<|endoftext|>
....it is very possible that those sources don't exist but are made up by fake news writers. #FakeNews is the enemy!

<|endoftext|>
Whenever you see the words 'sources say' in the fake news media, and they don't mention names....
<|endoftext|>
It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media.
<|endoftext|>
Just returned from Europe. Trip was a great success for America. Hard work but big results!
<|endoftext|>
Big win in Montana for Republicans!

Just arrived in Italy after having a very successful NATO meeting in Brussels. Told other nations they must pay more, not fair to  U.S.

Bringing hundreds of billions of dollars back to the U.S.A. from the Middle East - which will mean JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!

<|endoftext|>
Just left the #G7Summit. Had great meetings on everything, especially on trade where....
<|endoftext|>
I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!
<|endoftext|>
Many NATO countries have agreed to step up payments considerably, as they should. Money is beginning to pour in- NATO will be much stronger.
<|endoftext|>
Big G7 meetings today. Lots of very important matters under discussion. First on the list, of course, is terrorism. #G7Taormina
<|endoftext|>
Getting ready to engage G7 leaders on many issues including economic growth, terrorism, and security.
<|endoftext|>
Just arrived in Italy for the G7. Trip has been very successful. We made and saved the USA many billions of dollars and millions of jobs.
<|endoftext|>
All civilized nations must join together to protect human life and the sacred right of our citizens to live in safety and in peace.
<|endoftext|>
Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Middle East were great. Trying hard for PEACE. Doing well. Heading to Vatican &amp, Pope, then #G7 and #NATO.
<|endoftext|>
Getting ready for my big foreign trip. Will be strongly protecting American interests - that's what I like to do!
<|endoftext|>
With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign &amp, Obama Administration, there was never a special counsel appointed!

This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!

I have been asking Director Comey &amp, others, from the beginning of my administration, to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community.....

As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining....
<|endoftext|>
We
<|endoftext|>
China just agreed that the U.S. will be allowed to sell beef, and other major products, into China once again. This is REAL news!
<|endoftext|>
When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?
<|endoftext|>
"James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!"
<|endoftext|>
"...Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???"
<|endoftext|>
As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!....
<|endoftext|>
Again, the story that there was collusion between the Russians &amp, Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election.
<|endoftext|>
Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election.
<|endoftext|>
Dems have been complaining for months &amp, months about Dir. Comey. Now that he has been fired they PRETEND to be aggrieved. Phony hypocrites!
<|endoftext|>
caught, he cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness...and now he is judge &amp, jury. He should be the one who is investigated for his acts.
<|endoftext|>
years, as a pol in Connecticut, Blumenthal would talk of his great bravery and conquests in Vietnam - except he was never there. When....
<|endoftext|>
"Watching Senator Richard Blumenthal speak of Comey is a joke. ""Richie"" devised one of the greatest military frauds in U.S. history. For...."
<|endoftext|>
Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!
<|endoftext|>
James Comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI.
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!
<|endoftext|>
"Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated recently, ""I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer."" Then acts so indignant.  #draintheswamp"
<|endoftext|>
Biggest story today between Clapper &amp, Yates is on surveillance. Why doesn't the media report on this? #FakeNews!
<|endoftext|>
The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?
<|endoftext|>
Sally Yates made the fake media extremely unhappy today --- she said nothing but old news!
<|endoftext|>
"Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is ""no evidence"" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump."
<|endoftext|>
Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Counsel.

General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that.

Rexnord of Indiana made a deal during the Obama Administration to move to Mexico. Fired their employees. Tax product big that's sold in U.S.

Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his big win today as the next President of France. I look very much forward to working with him!
<|endoftext|>
Republican Senators will not let the American people down! ObamaCare premiums and deductibles are way up - it was a lie and it is dead!
<|endoftext|>
When will the Fake Media ask about the Dems dealings with Russia &amp, why the DNC wouldn't allow the FBI to check their server or investigate?
<|endoftext|>
The reason I am staying in Bedminster, N. J., a beautiful community, is that staying in NYC is much more expensive and disruptive. Meetings!
<|endoftext|>
Great jobs report today - It is all beginning to work!
<|endoftext|>
Why is it that the Fake News rarely reports Ocare is on its last legs and that insurance companies are fleeing for their lives? It's dead!
<|endoftext|>
Wow,the Fake News media did everything in its power to make the Republican Healthcare victory look as bad as possible.Far better than Ocare!
<|endoftext|>
Of course the Australians have better healthcare than we do --everybody does. ObamaCare is dead! But our healthcare will soon be great.
<|endoftext|>
Rather than causing a big disruption in N.Y.C., I will be working out of my home in Bedminster, N.J. this weekend. Also saves country money!
<|endoftext|>
Big win in the House - very exciting! But when everything comes together with the inclusion of Phase 2, we will have truly great healthcare!
<|endoftext|>
If victorious, Republicans will be having a big press conference at the beautiful Rose Garden of the White House immediately after vote!
<|endoftext|>
Insurance companies are fleeing ObamaCare - it is dead. Our healthcare plan will lower premiums &amp, deductibles - and be great healthcare!
<|endoftext|>
"I am watching the Democrats trying to defend the ""you can keep you doctor, you can keep your plan &amp, premiums will go down"" ObamaCare lie."""
<|endoftext|>
The Fake News media is officially out of control. They will do or say anything in order to get attention - never been a time like this!

...allegations of unmasking Trump transition officials. Not good!
<|endoftext|>
Susan Rice, the former National Security Advisor to President Obama, is refusing to testify before a Senate Subcommittee next week on.....

...Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?

FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony...

"either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%. Our country needs a good ""shutdown"" in September to fix mess!"

President Andrew Jackson, who died 16 years before the Civil War started, saw it coming and was angry. Would never have let it happen!

You can't compare anything to ObamaCare because ObamaCare is dead. Dems want billions to go to Insurance Companies to bail out donors....New

The Democrats, without a leader, have become the party of obstruction.They are only interested in themselves and not in what's best for U.S.

Big excitement last night in the Great State of Pennsylvania! Fantastic crowd and people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Mainstream (FAKE) media refuses to state our long list of achievements, including 28 legislative signings, strong borders &amp, great optimism!
<|endoftext|>
Looking forward to RALLY in the Great State of Pennsylvania tonight at 7:30. Big crowd, big energy!
<|endoftext|>
North Korea disrespected the wishes of China &amp, its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!
<|endoftext|>
We are making tremendous progress with the V. A. There has never been so much done so quickly, and we have just started. We love our VETS!
<|endoftext|>
As families prepare for summer vacations in our National Parks - Democrats threaten to close them and shut down the government. Terrible!
<|endoftext|>
Democrats used to support border security — now they want illegals to pour through our borders.
<|endoftext|>
Democrats jeopardizing the safety of our troops to bail out their donors from insurance companies. It is time to put #AmericaFirst🇺🇸
<|endoftext|>
What's more important? Rebuilding our military - or bailing out insurance companies? Ask the Democrats.
<|endoftext|>
I promise to rebuild our military and secure our border. Democrats want to shut down the government. Politics!
<|endoftext|>
I want to help our miners while the Democrats are blocking their healthcare.
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats want to shut government if we don't bail out Puerto Rico and give billions to their insurance companies for OCare failure. NO!
<|endoftext|>
...subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all, we will then terminate NAFTA. Relationships are good-deal very possible!
<|endoftext|>
I received calls from the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada asking to renegotiate NAFTA rather than terminate. I agreed..
<|endoftext|>
Democrats are trying to bail out insurance companies from disastrous #ObamaCare, and Puerto Rico with your tax dollars. Sad!
<|endoftext|>
The U.S. recorded its slowest economic growth in five years (2016). GDP up only 1.6%. Trade deficits hurt the economy very badly.

"...the Ninth Circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%). They used to call this ""judge shopping!"" Messy system."
<|endoftext|>
"Out of our very big country, with many choices, does everyone notice that both the ""ban"" case and now the ""sanctuary"" case is brought in ..."
<|endoftext|>
First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban &amp, now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!

Don't let the fake media tell you that I have changed my position on the WALL. It will get built and help stop drugs, human trafficking etc.
<|endoftext|>
Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this. Watch!
<|endoftext|>
If our healthcare plan is approved, you will see real healthcare and premiums will start tumbling down. ObamaCare is in a death spiral!
<|endoftext|>
....the wall is not built, which it will be, the drug situation will NEVER be fixed the way it should be!#BuildTheWall

The Wall is a very important tool in stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth (and many others)! If

The two fake news polls released yesterday, ABC &amp, NBC, while containing some very positive info, were totally wrong in General E. Watch!
<|endoftext|>
...popular vote. ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me &amp, 53% said strong leader.
<|endoftext|>
New polls out today are very good considering that much of the media is FAKE and almost always negative. Would still beat Hillary in .....
<|endoftext|>
Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall.
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats don't want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members.
<|endoftext|>
ObamaCare is in serious trouble. The Dems need big money to keep it going - otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought.

No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, &amp, it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!

Another terrorist attack in Paris. The people of France will not take much more of this. Will have a big effect on presidential election!

Dems failed in Kansas and are now failing in Georgia. Great job Karen Handel! It is now Hollywood vs. Georgia on June 20th.
<|endoftext|>
"Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG ""R"" win with runoff in Georgia. Glad to be of help!"
<|endoftext|>
Republicans must get out today and VOTE in Georgia 6. Force runoff and easy win! Dem Ossoff will raise your taxes-very bad on crime &amp, 2nd A.
<|endoftext|>
Democrat Jon Ossoff would be a disaster in Congress. VERY weak on crime and illegal immigration, bad for jobs and wants higher taxes. Say NO
<|endoftext|>
The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S. We are removing them fast!
<|endoftext|>
"With eleven Republican candidates running in Georgia (on Tuesday) for Congress, a runoff will be a win. Vote ""R"" for lower taxes &amp, safety!"
<|endoftext|>
The super Liberal Democrat in the Georgia Congressioal race tomorrow wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes!
<|endoftext|>
The Fake Media (not Real Media) has gotten even worse since the election. Every story is badly slanted. We have to hold them to the truth!
<|endoftext|>
"A great book for your reading enjoyment: ""REASONS TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS"" by Michael J. Knowles."
<|endoftext|>
The recent Kansas election (Congress) was a really big media event, until the Republicans won. Now they play the same game with Georgia-BAD!
<|endoftext|>
Our military is building and is rapidly becoming stronger than ever before. Frankly, we have no choice!
<|endoftext|>
Someone should look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday. The election is over!
<|endoftext|>
I did what was an almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again?
<|endoftext|>
Happy Easter to everyone!
<|endoftext|>
Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem? We will see what happens!
<|endoftext|>
Things will work out fine between the U.S.A. and Russia. At the right time everyone will come to their senses &amp, there will be lasting peace!
<|endoftext|>
I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea. If they are unable to do so, the U.S., with its allies, will! U.S.A.
<|endoftext|>
Jobs are returning, illegal immigration is plummeting, law, order and justice are being restored. We are truly making America great again!

Economic confidence is soaring as we unleash the power of private sector job creation and stand up for the American Workers. #AmericaFirst

Great win in Kansas last night for Ron Estes, easily winning the Congressional race against the Dems, who spent heavily &amp, predicted victory!
<|endoftext|>
Had a very good call last night with the President of China concerning the menace of North Korea.
<|endoftext|>
Ron Estes is running TODAY for Congress in the Great State of Kansas. A wonderful guy, I need his help on Healthcare &amp, Tax Cuts (Reform).
<|endoftext|>
North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them!  U.S.A.
<|endoftext|>
I explained to the President of China that a trade deal with the U.S. will be far better for them if they solve the North Korean problem!

Was the brother of John Podesta paid big money to get the sanctions on Russia lifted? Did Hillary know?

The real story turns out to be SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING! Find the leakers.
<|endoftext|>
Talks on Repealing and Replacing ObamaCare are, and have been, going on, and will continue until such time as a deal is hopefully struck.
<|endoftext|>
Anybody (especially  Fake News media) who thinks that Repeal &amp, Replace of ObamaCare is dead does not know the love and strength in R Party!
<|endoftext|>
"..not associated with Russia. Trump team spied on before he was nominated."" If this is true, does not get much bigger. Would be sad for U.S."
<|endoftext|>
"...use subsidies to buy health plans."" In other words, Ocare is dead. Good things will happen, however, either with Republicans or Dems."
<|endoftext|>
"It is the same Fake News Media that said there is ""no path to victory for Trump"" that is now pushing the phony Russia story. A total scam!"
<|endoftext|>
Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media &amp, Dems, of historic proportion!
<|endoftext|>
...and job losses. American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives.

The meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits...

The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, &amp, fast. We must fight them, &amp, Dems, in 2018!
<|endoftext|>
If the people of our great country could only see how viciously and inaccurately my administration is covered by certain media!
<|endoftext|>
Big announcement by Ford today. Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants. Car companies coming back to U.S.  JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats will make a deal with me on healthcare as soon as ObamaCare folds - not long. Do not worry, we are in very  good shape!
<|endoftext|>
The Republican House Freedom Caucus was able to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. After so many bad years they were ready for a win!
<|endoftext|>
"...money to Bill, the Hillary Russian ""reset,"" praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian Company. Trump Russia story is a hoax. #MAGA!"

General Kelly is doing a great job at the border. Numbers are way down. Many are not even trying to come in anymore.
<|endoftext|>
Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood &amp, Ocare!
<|endoftext|>
Thanks you for all of the Trump Rallies today. Amazing support. We will all MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!
<|endoftext|>
The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan!
<|endoftext|>
After seven horrible years of ObamaCare (skyrocketing premiums &amp, deductibles, bad healthcare), this is finally your chance for a great plan!
<|endoftext|>
A great American, Kurt Cochran, was killed in the London terror attack. My prayers and condolences are with his family and friends.
<|endoftext|>
Just watched the totally biased and fake news reports of the so-called Russia story on NBC and ABC. Such dishonesty!

Spoke to U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May today to offer condolences on the terrorist attack in London. She is strong and doing very well.
<|endoftext|>
Big day for healthcare. Working hard!
<|endoftext|>
What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?
<|endoftext|>
Just heard Fake News CNN is doing polls again despite the fact that their election polls were a WAY OFF disaster. Much higher ratings at Fox
<|endoftext|>
The real story that Congress, the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now!
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College &amp, lost!
<|endoftext|>
James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it!
<|endoftext|>
...vast sums of money to NATO &amp, the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!

ObamaCare is imploding. It is a disaster and 2017 will be the worst year yet, by far! Republicans will come together and save the day.
<|endoftext|>
It is amazing how rude much of the media is to my very hard working representatives. Be nice, you will do much better!
<|endoftext|>
We are making great progress with healthcare. ObamaCare is imploding and will only get worse. Republicans coming together to get job done!

Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!

Don't let the FAKE NEWS tell you that there is big infighting in the Trump Admin. We are getting along great, and getting major things done!

Is it true the DNC would not allow the FBI access to check server or other equipment after learning it was hacked? Can that be possible?

Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me. Sad end to great show

How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!
<|endoftext|>
I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!
<|endoftext|>
"Is it legal for a sitting President to be ""wire tapping"" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!"
<|endoftext|>
Just out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times, and 4 times last year alone.
<|endoftext|>
"Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!"
<|endoftext|>
The first meeting Jeff Sessions had with the Russian Amb was set up by the Obama Administration under education program for 100 Ambs......

It is so pathetic that the Dems have still not approved my full Cabinet.

...to win. The Democrats are overplaying their hand. They lost the election, and now they have lost their grip on reality. The real story...
<|endoftext|>
...intentional. This whole narrative is a way of saving face for Democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed.....

Big dinner with Governors tonight at White House. Much to be discussed, including healthcare.
<|endoftext|>
Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks!
<|endoftext|>
"The race for DNC Chairman was, of course, totally ""rigged."" Bernie's guy, like Bernie himself, never had a chance. Clinton demanded Perez!"
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC. I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party!
<|endoftext|>
I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!

Great optimism for future of U.S. business, AND JOBS, with the DOW having an 11th straight record close. Big tax &amp, regulation cuts coming!

The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo.

Seven people shot and killed yesterday in Chicago. What is going on there - totally out of control. Chicago needs help!
<|endoftext|>
Very much enjoyed my tour of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture...A great job done by amazing people!
<|endoftext|>
One thing I will say about Rep. Keith Ellison, in his fight to lead the DNC, is that he was the one who predicted early that I would win!
<|endoftext|>
The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists. Sad!
<|endoftext|>
Just named General H.R. McMaster National Security Advisor.
<|endoftext|>
Meeting with Generals at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Very interesting!
<|endoftext|>
HAPPY PRESIDENTS DAY - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Give the public a break - The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT!
<|endoftext|>
Getting ready to leave for Melbourne, Florida. See you all soon!
<|endoftext|>
Will be having many meetings this weekend at The Southern White House. Big 5:00 P.M. speech in Melbourne, Florida. A lot to talk about!
<|endoftext|>
Don't believe the main stream (fake news) media.The White House is running VERY WELL. I inherited a MESS and am in the process of fixing it.
<|endoftext|>
Looking forward to the Florida rally tomorrow. Big crowd expected!
<|endoftext|>
"""One of the most effective press conferences I've ever seen!"" says Rush Limbaugh. Many agree.Yet FAKE MEDIA  calls it differently! Dishonest"
<|endoftext|>
General Keith Kellogg, who I have known for a long time, is very much in play for NSA - as are three others.
<|endoftext|>
Thank you for all of the nice statements on the Press Conference yesterday. Rush Limbaugh said one of greatest ever. Fake media not happy!
<|endoftext|>
Going to Charleston, South Carolina, in order to spend time with Boeing and talk jobs! Look forward to it.
<|endoftext|>
Despite the long delays by the Democrats in finally approving Dr. Tom Price, the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare is moving fast!
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election, and so badly (306), so they made up a story - RUSSIA. Fake news!
<|endoftext|>
"FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and ""sources,"" is far more effective than the discredited Democrats - but they are fading fast!"
<|endoftext|>
The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers! They will be caught!
<|endoftext|>
Stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades. Great level of confidence and optimism - even before tax plan rollout!

What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow!

"The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ""intelligence"" like candy. Very un-American!"
<|endoftext|>
Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?
<|endoftext|>
"Thank you to Eli Lake of The Bloomberg View - ""The NSA &amp, FBI...should not interfere in our politics...and is"" Very serious situation for USA"
<|endoftext|>
This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign.
<|endoftext|>
The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?
<|endoftext|>
Just leaving Florida. Big crowds of enthusiastic supporters lining the road that the FAKE NEWS media refuses to mention. Very dishonest!
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations Stephen Miller- on representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows. Great job!

The crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise. Gang members, drug dealers &amp, others are being removed!
<|endoftext|>
A working dinner tonight with Prime Minister Abe of Japan, and his representatives, at the Winter White House (Mar-a-Lago). Very good talks!
<|endoftext|>
I am so proud of my daughter Ivanka. To be abused and treated so badly by the media, and to still hold her head so high, is truly wonderful!

<|endoftext|>
I am reading that the great border WALL will cost more than the government originally thought, but I have not gotten involved in the.....
<|endoftext|>
"Our legal system is broken! ""77% of refugees allowed into U.S. since travel reprieve hail from seven suspect countries."" (WT)  SO DANGEROUS!"
<|endoftext|>
"LAWFARE: ""Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute."" A disgraceful decision!"

SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!
<|endoftext|>
"..Ryan died on a winning mission ( according to General Mattis), not a ""failure."" Time for the U.S. to get smart and start winning again!"
<|endoftext|>
...long he doesn't know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in - bogged down in conflict all over the place. Our hero..
<|endoftext|>
Sen. McCain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy! He's been losing so....
<|endoftext|>
"Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave ""service"" in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS!"
<|endoftext|>
Sen.Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie),now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?

Big increase in traffic into our country from certain areas, while our people are far more vulnerable, as we wait for what should be EASY D!
<|endoftext|>
I will be speaking at 9:00 A.M. today to Police Chiefs and Sheriffs and will be discussing the horrible, dangerous and wrong decision.......
<|endoftext|>
If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics!
<|endoftext|>
It is a disgrace that my full Cabinet is still not in place, the longest such delay in the history of our country. Obstruction by Democrats!
<|endoftext|>
I don't know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy - yet Obama can make a deal with Iran, #1 in terror, no problem!

I don't know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy - yet Obama can make a deal with Iran, #1in terror, no problem!
<|endoftext|>
The threat from radical Islamic terrorism is very real, just look at what is happening in Europe and the Middle-East. Courts must act fast!
<|endoftext|>
I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!
<|endoftext|>
Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.
<|endoftext|>
Enjoy the #SuperBowl and then we continue: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!
<|endoftext|>
Just cannot  believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!
<|endoftext|>
The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!
<|endoftext|>
Why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?
<|endoftext|>
Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision
<|endoftext|>
What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?
<|endoftext|>
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!
<|endoftext|>
Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it's death &amp, destruction!
<|endoftext|>
When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in &amp, out, especially for reasons of safety &amp,.security - big trouble!
<|endoftext|>
Countries charge U.S. companies taxes or tariffs while the U.S. charges them nothing or little.We should charge them SAME as they charge us!

"We must keep ""evil"" out of our country!"

A new radical Islamic terrorist has just attacked in Louvre Museum in Paris. Tourists were locked down. France on edge again. GET SMART U.S.

Professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
<|endoftext|>
Meeting with biggest business leaders this morning. Good jobs are coming back to U.S., health care and tax bills are being crafted NOW!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to Prime Minister of Australia for telling the truth about our very civil conversation that FAKE NEWS media lied about. Very nice!
<|endoftext|>
"Iran is playing with fire - they don't appreciate how ""kind"" President Obama was to them. Not me!"
<|endoftext|>
Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger did a really bad job as Governor of California and even worse on the Apprentice...but at least he tried hard!
<|endoftext|>
Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion
<|endoftext|>
Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile.Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them!
<|endoftext|>
Attending Chief Ryan Owens' Dignified Transfer yesterday with my daughter Ivanka was my great honor. To a great and brave man - thank you!
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations to Rex Tillerson on being sworn in as our new Secretary of State. He will be a star!
<|endoftext|>
If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS?
<|endoftext|>
Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!
<|endoftext|>
Iran is rapidly taking over more and more of Iraq even after the U.S. has squandered three trillion dollars there. Obvious long ago!
<|endoftext|>
Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!
<|endoftext|>
Hope you like my nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the United States Supreme Court. He is a good and brilliant man, respected by all.
<|endoftext|>
Getting ready to deliver a VERY IMPORTANT DECISION!  8:00 P.M.
<|endoftext|>
When will the Democrats give us our Attorney General and rest of Cabinet! They should be ashamed of themselves! No wonder D.C. doesn't work!
<|endoftext|>
Nancy Pelosi and Fake Tears Chuck Schumer held a rally  at the steps of The Supreme Court and mic did not work (a mess)-just like Dem party!
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats are delaying my cabinet picks for purely political reasons. They have nothing going but to obstruct. Now have an Obama A.G.
<|endoftext|>
Where was all the outrage from Democrats and the opposition party (the media) when our jobs were fleeing our country?
<|endoftext|>
I have made my decision on who I will nominate for The United States Supreme Court. It will be announced live on Tuesday at 8:00 P.M. (W.H.)
<|endoftext|>
"If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the ""bad"" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad ""dudes"" out there!"

There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign. Study the world!

Busy week planned with a heavy focus on jobs and national security. Top executives coming in at 9:00 A.M. to talk manufacturing in America.

Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views.
<|endoftext|>
Wow, television ratings just out: 31 million people watched the Inauguration, 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago!
<|endoftext|>
Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly.

An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED, as has been reported by the media. Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!

I hope the people over at the Fed will read today’s Wall Street Journal Editorial before they make yet another mistake. Also, don’t let the market become any more illiquid than it already is. Stop with the 50 B’s. Feel the market, don’t just go by meaningless numbers. Good luck!

Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!

Biggest outrage yet in the long, winding and highly conflicted Mueller Witch Hunt is the fact that 19,000 demanded Text messages between Peter Strzok and his FBI lover, Lisa Page, were purposely &amp, illegally deleted. Would have explained whole Hoax, which is now under protest!

Anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Border Security without a Wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line. Time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have, at the same time, far greater safety and control!

The Democrats policy of Child Seperation on the Border during the Obama Administration was far worse than the way we handle it now. Remember the 2014 picture of children in cages - the Obama years. However, if you don’t separate, FAR more people will come. Smugglers use the kids!

Remember, Michael Cohen only became a “Rat” after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable &amp, unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started. They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY’S OFFICE! Why didn’t they break into the DNC to get the Server, or Crooked’s office?
<|endoftext|>
So where are all the missing Text messages between fired FBI agents Peter S and the lovely Lisa Page, his lover. Just reported that they have been erased and wiped clean. What an outrage as the totally compromised and conflicted Witch Hunt moves ever so slowly forward. Want them!
<|endoftext|>
A REAL scandal is the one sided coverage, hour by hour, of networks like NBC &amp, Democrat spin machines like Saturday Night Live. It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials. Should be tested in courts, can’t be legal? Only defame &amp, belittle! Collusion?
<|endoftext|>
Wow, 19,000 Texts between Lisa Page and her lover, Peter S of the FBI, in charge of the Russia Hoax, were just reported as being wiped clean and gone. Such a big story that will never be covered by the Fake News. Witch Hunt!

James Comey’s behind closed doors testimony reveals that “there was not evidence of Campaign Collusion” with Russia when he left the FBI. In other words, the Witch Hunt is illegal and should never have been started!

On 245  occasions, former FBI Director James Comey told House investigators he didn’t know, didn’t recall, or couldn’t remember things when asked. Opened investigations on 4 Americans (not 2) - didn’t know who signed off and didn’t know Christopher Steele. All lies!

Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries. Do it by plane, do it by bus, do it anyway you want, but they are NOT coming into the U.S.A. We will close the Border permanently if need be. Congress, fund the WALL!

The Stock Market is up massively since the Election, but is now taking a little pause - people want to see what happens with the Midterms. If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat. They like the Venezuela financial model, High Taxes &amp, Open Borders!

Congressman Kevin Brady of Texas is so popular in his District, and far beyond, that he doesn’t need any help - but I am giving it to him anyway. He is a great guy and the absolute “King” of Cutting Taxes. Highly respected by all, he loves his State &amp, Country. Strong Endorsement!
<|endoftext|>
Congressman Andy Barr of Kentucky, who just had a great debate with his Nancy Pelosi run opponent, has been a winner for his State. Strong on Crime, the Border, Tax Cuts, Military, Vets and 2nd Amendment, we need Andy in D.C. He has my Strong Endorsement!

Check out tweets from last two days. I refer to Fake News Media when mentioning Enemy of the People - but dishonest reporters use only the word “Media.” The people of our Great Country are angry and disillusioned at receiving so much Fake News. They get it, and fully understand!
<|endoftext|>
CNN and others in the Fake News Business keep purposely and inaccurately reporting that I said the “Media is the Enemy of the People.” Wrong! I said that the “Fake News (Media) is the Enemy of the People,” a very big difference. When you give out false information - not good!
<|endoftext|>
Great job being done by Congressman Keith Rothfus of Pennsylvania. Thank you Keith!

Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border. Please go back, you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!

<|endoftext|>
There is great anger in our Country caused in part by inaccurate, and even fraudulent, reporting of the news. The Fake News Media, the true Enemy of the People, must stop the open &amp, obvious hostility &amp, report the news accurately &amp, fairly. That will do much to put out the flame...
<|endoftext|>
The Fake News is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans, Conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our Country. Actually, it is their Fake &amp, Dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand!

Watching the Dodgers/Red Sox final innings. It is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who is loose &amp, dominating through almost 7 innings, Rich Hill of Dodgers, and brings in nervous reliever(s) who get shellacked. 4 run lead gone. Managers do it all the time, big mistake!

Events in Pittsburgh are far more devastating than originally thought. Spoke with Mayor and Governor to inform them that the Federal Government has been, and will be, with them all the way. I will speak to the media shortly and make further statement at Future Farmers of America.

Watching the events unfolding in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Law enforcement on the scene. People in Squirrel Hill area should remain sheltered. Looks like multiple fatalities. Beware of active shooter. God Bless All!

The United States has been spending Billions of Dollars a year on Illegal Immigration. This will not continue. Democrats must give us the votes to pass strong (but fair) laws. If not, we will be forced to play a much tougher hand.
<|endoftext|>
Funny how lowly rated CNN, and others, can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of Bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombing, yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream, “it’s just not Presidential!”
<|endoftext|>
...I agree with their stance 100%, and the United States is likewise taking a very hard line on illegal immigration. The Prime Minister is working very hard on the economy of Italy - he will be successful!

To those in the Caravan, turnaround, we are not letting people into the United States illegally. Go back to your Country and if you want, apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing!

The New York Times has a new Fake Story that now the Russians and Chinese (glad they finally added China) are listening to all of my calls on cellphones. Except that I rarely use a cellphone, &amp, when I do it’s government authorized. I like Hard Lines. Just more made up Fake News!
<|endoftext|>
A very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News. It has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description. Mainstream Media must clean up its act, FAST!
<|endoftext|>
The so-called experts on Trump over at the New York Times wrote a long and boring article on my cellphone usage that is so incorrect I do not have time here to correct it. I only use Government Phones, and have only one seldom used government cell phone. Story is soooo wrong!

Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S. We will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them.

Every time you see a Caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our Country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic Immigration Laws! Remember the Midterms! So unfair to those who come in legally.

Sadly, it looks like Mexico’s Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan heading to the Southern Border of the United States. Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in. I have alerted Border Patrol and Military that this is a National Emergy. Must change laws!

Full efforts are being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our Souther Border. People have to apply for asylum in Mexico first, and if they fail to do that, the U.S. will turn them away. The courts are asking the U.S. to do things that are not doable!

The only thing keeping Tester alive is he has millions and millions of dollars from outside liberals and leftists, who couldn’t care less about our Country!

....In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!..

Pocahontas (the bad version), sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren, is getting slammed. She took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024, far less than the average American. Now Cherokee Nation denies her, “DNA test is useless.” Even they don’t want her. Phony!

....Remember, NAFTA was one of the WORST Trade Deals ever made. The U.S. lost thousands of businesses and millions of jobs. We were far better off before NAFTA - should never have been signed. Even the Vat Tax was not accounted for. We make new deal or go back to pre-NAFTA!
<|endoftext|>
There is no political necessity to keep Canada in the new NAFTA deal. If we don’t make a fair deal for the U.S. after decades of abuse, Canada will be out. Congress should not interfere w/ these negotiations or I will simply terminate NAFTA entirely &amp, we will be far better off...

....Donald Trump, and now we find out that there wasn’t even a hearing - that Donald Trump’s 4th Amendment right to privacy was signed away...and someone in there is swearing that this stuff is true, when it wasn’t? This is the scandal here - a police state.”  Dan Bongino

The ABC/Washington Post Poll was by far the least accurate one 2 weeks out from the 2016 Election. I call it a suppression poll - but by Election Day they brought us, out of shame, to about even. They will never learn!

Wow, I made OFF THE RECORD COMMENTS to Bloomberg concerning Canada, and this powerful understanding was BLATANTLY VIOLATED. Oh well, just more dishonest reporting. I am used to it. At least Canada knows where I stand!

I will be doing a major rally for Senator Ted Cruz in October. I’m picking the biggest stadium in Texas we can find. As you know, Ted has my complete and total Endorsement. His opponent is a disaster for Texas - weak on Second Amendment, Crime, Borders, Military, and Vets!

Kevin Stitt ran a great winning campaign against a very tough opponent in Oklahoma. Kevin is a very successful businessman who will be a fantastic Governor. He is strong on Crime &amp, Borders, the 2nd Amendment, &amp, loves our Military &amp, Vets. He has my complete and total Endorsement!

I am very excited about the person who will be taking the place of Don McGahn as White House Counsel! I liked Don, but he was NOT responsible for me not firing Bob Mueller or Jeff Sessions. So much Fake Reporting and Fake News!

Ivanka Trump &amp, Jared Kushner had NOTHING to do with the so called “pushing out” of Don McGahn.The Fake News Media has it, purposely,so wrong! They love to portray chaos in the White House when they know that chaos doesn’t exist-just a “smooth running machine” with changing parts!

Hillary Clinton’s Emails, many of which are Classified Information, got hacked by China. Next move better be by the FBI &amp, DOJ or, after all of their other missteps (Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Ohr, FISA, Dirty Dossier etc.), their credibility will be forever gone!

Big story out that the FBI ignored tens of thousands of Crooked Hillary Emails, many of which are REALLY BAD. Also gave false election info. I feel sure that we will soon be getting to the bottom of all of this corruption. At some point I may have to get involved!

Jeff Sessions said he wouldn’t allow politics to influence him only because he doesn’t understand what is happening underneath his command position. Highly conflicted Bob Mueller and his gang of 17 Angry Dems are having a field day as real corruption goes untouched. No Collusion!

Michael Cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime. President Obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled!

A large number of counts, ten, could not even be decided in the Paul Manafort case. Witch Hunt!
<|endoftext|>
I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. “Justice” took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to “break” - make up stories in order to get a “deal.” Such respect for a brave man!

If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of Michael Cohen!

It is outrageous that Poisonous Synthetic Heroin Fentanyl comes pouring into the U.S. Postal System from China. We can, and must, END THIS NOW! The Senate should pass the STOP ACT – and firmly STOP this poison from killing our children and destroying our country. No more delay!

Everybody wants to keep their Security Clearance, it’s worth great prestige and big dollars, even board seats, and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect Brennan. It certainly isn’t because of the good job he did! He is a political “hack.”
<|endoftext|>
I hope John Brennan, the worst CIA Director in our country’s history, brings a lawsuit. It will then be very easy to get all of his records, texts, emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did, but how he was involved with the Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt. He won’t sue!
<|endoftext|>
Where’s the Collusion? They made up a phony crime called Collusion, and when there was no Collusion they say there was Obstruction (of a phony crime that never existed). If you FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt, they scream Obstruction!
<|endoftext|>
....looking for trouble. They are enjoying ruining people’s lives and REFUSE to look at the real corruption on the Democrat side - the lies, the firings, the deleted Emails and soooo much more! Mueller’s Angry Dems are looking to impact the election. They are a National Disgrace!
<|endoftext|>
Disgraced and discredited Bob Mueller and his whole group of Angry Democrat Thugs spent over 30 hours with the White House Councel, only with my approval, for purposes of transparency. Anybody needing that much time when they know there is no Russian Collusion is just someone....

Some members of the media are very Angry at the Fake Story in the New York Times. They actually called to complain and apologize - a big step forward. From the day I announced, the Times has been Fake News, and with their disgusting new Board Member, it will only get worse!
<|endoftext|>
The Failing New York Times wrote a story that made it seem like the White House Councel had TURNED on the President, when in fact it is just the opposite - &amp, the two Fake reporters knew this. This is why the Fake News Media has become the Enemy of the People. So bad for America!
<|endoftext|>
No Collusion and No Obstruction, except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats. All of the resignations and corruption, yet heavily conflicted Bob Mueller refuses to even look in that direction. What about the Brennan, Comey, McCabe, Strzok lies to Congress, or Crooked’s Emails!
<|endoftext|>
....and have demanded transparency so that this Rigged and Disgusting Witch Hunt can come to a close. So many lives have been ruined over nothing - McCarthyism at its WORST! Yet Mueller &amp, his gang of Dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side - Media is even worse!
<|endoftext|>

In speaking with some of the world’s top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business (jobs) even better in the U.S. “Stop quarterly reporting &amp, go to a six month system,” said one. That would allow greater flexibility &amp, save money. I have asked the SEC to study!

The Rigged Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on as the “originators and founders” of this scam continue to be fired and demoted for their corrupt and illegal activity. All credibility is gone from this terrible Hoax, and much more will be lost as it proceeds. No Collusion!

Lou Dobbs: “This cannot go forward...this Special Counsel with all of his conflicts, with his 17 Angry Democrats, without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia. The Dems are the ones who should be investigated.” Thank you Lou, so true!
<|endoftext|>
Strzok started the illegal Rigged Witch Hunt - why isn’t this so-called “probe” ended immediately? Why aren’t these angry and conflicted Democrats instead looking at Crooked Hillary?
<|endoftext|>
Fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok is a fraud, as is the rigged investigation he started. There was no Collusion or Obstruction with Russia, and everybody, including the Democrats, know it. The only Collusion and Obstruction was by Crooked Hillary, the Democrats and the DNC!

Just fired Agent Strzok, formerly of the FBI, was in charge of the Crooked Hillary Clinton sham investigation. It was a total fraud on the American public and should be properly redone!

Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally. The list of bad players in the FBI &amp, DOJ gets longer &amp, longer. Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt, will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax. No Collusion, No Obstruction - I just fight back!
<|endoftext|>
While I know it’s “not presidential” to take on a lowlife like Omarosa, and while I would rather not be doing so, this is a modern day form of communication and I know the Fake News Media will be working overtime to make even Wacky Omarosa look legitimate as possible. Sorry!
<|endoftext|>
...really bad things. Nasty to people &amp, would constantly miss meetings &amp, work. When Gen. Kelly came on board he told me she was a loser &amp, nothing but problems. I told him to try working it out, if possible, because she only said GREAT things about me - until she got fired!
<|endoftext|>
Wacky Omarosa, who got fired 3 times on the Apprentice, now got fired for the last time. She never made it, never will. She begged me for a job, tears in her eyes, I said Ok. People in the White House hated her. She was vicious, but not smart. I would rarely see her but heard....

<|endoftext|>
The big story that the Fake News Media refuses to report is lowlife Christopher Steele’s many meetings with Deputy A.G. Bruce Ohr and his beautiful wife, Nelly. It was Fusion GPS that hired Steele to write the phony &amp, discredited Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary &amp, the DNC....

Tariffs are working big time. Every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the U.S., always to our detriment. I say, as they come,Tax them. If they don’t want to be taxed, let them make or build the product in the U.S. In either event, it means jobs and great wealth.....

Thank you Georgia! They say that my endorsement last week of Brian Kemp, in the Republican Primary for Governor against a very worthy opponent, lifted him from 5 points down to a 70% to 30% victory! Two very good and talented men in a great race, but congratulations to Brian!

<|endoftext|>
Congratulations to Brian Kemp on your very big win in Georgia last night. Wow, 69-30, those are big numbers. Now go win against the open border, crime loving opponent that the Democrats have given you. She is weak on Vets, the Military and the 2nd Amendment. Win!

What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad! Is this a first, never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? Too bad!
<|endoftext|>
China is targeting our farmers, who they know I love &amp, respect, as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the U.S. They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt. We were being nice - until now! China made $517 Billion on us last year.

When you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation, it will only take longer to make a deal, and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity. Negotiations are going really well, be cool. The end result will be worth it!
<|endoftext|>
Every time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs, I wonder, what can they be thinking? Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off?  Lost $817 Billion on Trade last year. No weakness!
<|endoftext|>
“The Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton &amp, Frame Donald Trump” is a Hot Seller, already Number One! More importantly, it is a great book that everyone is talking about. It covers the Rigged Witch Hunt brilliantly. Congratulations to Gregg Jarrett!

The European Union is coming to Washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on Trade. I have an idea for them. Both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies! That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade! Hope they do it, we are ready - but they won’t!
<|endoftext|>
I’m very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election. Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely don’t want Trump!

Tariffs are the greatest! Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with Tariffs. It’s as simple as that - and everybody’s talking! Remember, we are the “piggy bank” that’s being robbed. All will be Great!
<|endoftext|>
Countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to Washington to negotiate. This should have taken place many years ago but,as the saying goes, better late than never!

....In my opinion the Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for Amazon. Is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought?
<|endoftext|>
The Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the Internet Tax Case in the U.S. Supreme Court two months ago. Next up is the U.S. Post Office which they use, at a fraction of real cost, as their “delivery boy” for a BIG percentage of their packages....

A Rocket has not been launched by North Korea in 9 months. Likewise, no Nuclear Tests. Japan is happy, all of Asia is happy. But the Fake News is saying, without ever asking me (always anonymous sources), that I am angry because it is not going fast enough. Wrong, very happy!
<|endoftext|>
When you hear the Fake News talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin, and all that I gave up, remember, I gave up NOTHING, we merely talked about future benefits for both countries. Also, we got along very well, which is a good thing, except for the Corrupt Media!
<|endoftext|>
....and the DOJ, FBI and Obama Gang need to be held to account. Source #1 was the major source. Avoided talking about it being the Clinton campaign behind it. Misled the Court to provide a pretext to SPY on the Trump Team. Not about Carter Page..was all about getting Trump.....
<|endoftext|>
“It was classified to cover up misconduct by the FBI and the Justice Department in misleading the Court by using this Dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the Trump Team. This is a Clinton Campaign document. It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump....
<|endoftext|>
So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier, that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC, that was knowingly &amp, falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt!

To Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE &amp, DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!
<|endoftext|>
So President Obama knew about Russia before the Election. Why didn’t he do something about it? Why didn’t he tell our campaign? Because it is all a big hoax, that’s why, and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win!!!

I had a GREAT meeting with Putin and the Fake News used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it. So bad for our country!

Andrew McCarthy - “I said this could never happen. This is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff, not just the people who gave it. It is so bad it screams out at you.”  On the whole FISA scam which led to the rigged Mueller Witch Hunt!
<|endoftext|>
Looking more &amp, more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC. Ask her how that worked out - she did better with Crazy Bernie. Republicans must get tough now. An illegal Scam!

No Collusion, No Obstruction - but that doesn’t matter because the 13 Angry Democrats, who are only after Republicans and totally protecting Democrats, want this Witch Hunt to drag out to the November Election. Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing!
<|endoftext|>
The Rigged Witch Hunt, headed by the 13 Angry Democrats (and now 4 more have been added, one who worked directly for Obama W.H.), seems intent on damaging the Republican Party’s chances in the November Election. This Democrat excuse for losing the ‘16 Election never ends!
<|endoftext|>
Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer’s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of &amp, perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!

The NFL National Anthem Debate is alive and well again - can’t believe it! Isn’t it in contract that players must stand at attention, hand on heart? The $40,000,000 Commissioner must now make a stand. First time kneeling, out for game. Second time kneeling, out for season/no pay!
<|endoftext|>
I got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin. In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy. If I was loud &amp, vicious, I would have been criticized for being too tough. Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim? Hypocrites!
<|endoftext|>
Farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years. The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election. A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries. They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers. Canada charges 275% on Dairy. Farmers will WIN!
<|endoftext|>
....The United States should not be penalized because we are doing so well. Tightening now hurts all that we have done. The U.S. should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and BAD Trade Deals. Debt coming due &amp, we are raising rates - Really?

China, the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower, while the U.S. is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day - taking away our big competitive edge. As usual, not a level playing field...

The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war. They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I’ll probably have a good relationship with Putin. We are doing MUCH better than any other country!
<|endoftext|>
The Fake News Media is going Crazy! They make up stories without any backup, sources or proof. Many of the stories written about me, and the good people surrounding me, are total fiction. Problem is, when you complain you just give them more publicity. But I’ll complain anyway!

While I had a great meeting with NATO, raising vast amounts of money, I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Sadly, it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy!

I had a great meeting with NATO. They have paid $33 Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future, only because of me. NATO was weak, but now it is strong again (bad for Russia). The media only says I was rude to leaders, never mentions the money!
<|endoftext|>
As I said today and many times before, “I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people.” However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past – as the world’s two largest nuclear powers, we must get along! #HELSINKI2018

<|endoftext|>
Received many calls from leaders of NATO countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations, both present &amp, future. We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media. NATO is now strong &amp, rich!

There hasn’t been a missile or rocket fired in 9 months in North Korea, there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages. Who knows how it will all turn out in the end, but why isn’t the Fake News talking about these wonderful facts? Because it is FAKE NEWS!
<|endoftext|>
These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years. Why didn’t Obama do something about it?  Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win, that’s why. Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration, but Fake News doesn’t want to report the truth, as usual!

So funny! I just checked out Fake News CNN, for the first time in a long time (they are dying in the ratings), to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of Jim Acosta (actually a nice guy). They didn’t! But they did say I already lost in my meeting with Putin. Fake News......

....On top of it all, Germany just started paying Russia, the country they want protection from, Billions of Dollars for their Energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from Russia. Not acceptable! All NATO Nations must meet their 2% commitment, and that must ultimately go to 4%!
<|endoftext|>
Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich NATO Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!
<|endoftext|>
Billions of additional dollars are being spent by NATO countries since my visit last year, at my request, but it isn’t nearly enough. U.S. spends too much. Europe’s borders are BAD! Pipeline dollars to Russia are not acceptable!

How can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started, influenced and worked on, for an extended period of time, by former FBI Agent/Lover Peter Strzok? Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear!

What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? Why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S. is paying for Europe’s protection, then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY, not by 2025.

The European Union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in Europe (U.S. has a $151 Billion trade deficit), and then they want us to happily defend them through NATO, and nicely pay for it. Just doesn’t work!

After having written many best selling books, and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write, it should be noted that the Fake News constantly likes to pore over my tweets looking for a mistake. I capitalize certain words only for emphasis, not b/c they should be capitalized!
<|endoftext|>
The Washington Post is constantly quoting “anonymous sources” that do not exist. Rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for. They are a disgrace to journalism but then again, so are many others!

Now that Harley-Davidson is moving part of its operation out of the U.S., my Administration is working with other Motor Cycle companies who want to move into the U.S. Harley customers are not happy with their move - sales are down 7% in 2017. The U.S. is where the Action is!

Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians - including to government officials. How big (and bad) is that?
<|endoftext|>
Many good conversations with North Korea-it is going well! In the meantime, no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in 8 months. All of Asia is thrilled. Only the Opposition Party, which includes the Fake News, is complaining. If not for me, we would now be at War with North Korea!
<|endoftext|>
How can the Democrats, who are weak on the Border and weak on Crime, do well in November. The people of our Country want and demand Safety and Security, while the Democrats are more interested in  ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great Law Enforcement!
<|endoftext|>
When we have an “infestation” of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ICE! They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do! Nov.
<|endoftext|>
The economy is doing perhaps better than ever before, and that’s prior to fixing some of the worst and most unfair Trade Deals ever made by any country. In any event, they are coming along very well. Most countries agree that they must be changed, but nobody ever asked!

I interviewed 4 very impressive people yesterday. On Monday I will be announcing my decision for Justice of the United States Supreme Court!
<|endoftext|>
Crazy Maxine Waters, said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics, is rapidly becoming, together with Nancy Pelosi, the FACE of the Democrat Party. Her ranting and raving, even referring to herself as a wounded animal, will make people flee the Democrats!
<|endoftext|>
Many Democrats are deeply concerned about the fact that their “leadership” wants to denounce and abandon the great men and women of ICE, thereby declaring war on Law &amp, Order. These people will be voting for Republicans in November and, in many cases, joining the Republican Party!
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!

A big week, especially with our numerous victories in the Supreme Court. Heading back to the White House now. Focus will be on the selection of a new Supreme Court Justice. Exciting times for our country. Economy may be stronger than it has ever been!
<|endoftext|>
The Liberal Left, also known as the Democrats, want to get rid of ICE, who do a fantastic job, and want Open Borders. Crime would be rampant and uncontrollable! Make America Great Again
<|endoftext|>
When people come into our Country illegally, we must IMMEDIATELY escort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering. Our laws are the dumbest anywhere in the world. Republicans want Strong Borders and no Crime. Dems want Open Borders and are weak on Crime!
<|endoftext|>
Either we need to elect more Republicans in November or Republicans must end the ridiculous 60 vote, or Filibuster, rule - or better yet, do both. Cryin’ Chuck would do it on day one, but we’ll never give him the chance. Some great legislation awaits - be smart!
<|endoftext|>
I never pushed the Republicans in the House to vote for the Immigration Bill, either GOODLATTE 1 or 2, because it could never have gotten enough Democrats as long as there is the 60 vote threshold. I released many prior to the vote knowing we need more Republicans to win in Nov.

A friend of mine and a man who has truly seen politics and life as few others ever will, Sean Spicer, has written a great new book, “The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President.” It is a story told with both heart and knowledge. Really good, go get it!

Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that, because of the turmoil &amp, disfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference...Prices to high! He has agreed!
<|endoftext|>
To the great and brave men and women of ICE, do not worry or lose your spirit. You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements. So brave! The radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police. Zero chance, It will never happen!
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats are making a strong push to abolish ICE, one of the smartest, toughest and most spirited law enforcement groups of men and women that I have ever seen. I have watched ICE liberate towns from the grasp of MS-13 &amp, clean out the toughest of situations. They are great!

Peter Strzok worked as the leader of the Rigged Witch Hunt for a long period of time - he got it started and was only fired because the gig was up. But remember, he took his orders from Comey and McCabe and they took their orders from you know who. Mueller/Comey best friends!
<|endoftext|>
Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election! Where is the DNC Server, and why didn’t Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it? Why isn’t Hillary/Russia being looked at? So many questions, so much corruption!
<|endoftext|>
Lover FBI Agent Peter Strzok was given poor marks on yesterday’s closed door testimony and, according to most reports, refused to answer many questions. There was no Collusion and the Witch Hunt, headed by 13 Angry Democrats and others who are totally conflicted, is Rigged!

Harley-Davidson should stay 100% in America, with the people that got you your success. I’ve done so much for you, and then this. Other companies are coming back where they belong! We won’t forget, and neither will your customers or your now very HAPPY competitors!
<|endoftext|>
Supreme Court rules in favor of non-union workers who are now, as an example, able to support a candidate of his or her choice without having those who control the Union deciding for them. Big loss for the coffers of the Democrats!

HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD PASS THE STRONG BUT FAIR IMMIGRATION BILL, KNOWN AS GOODLATTE II, IN THEIR AFTERNOON VOTE TODAY, EVEN THOUGH THE DEMS WON’T LET IT PASS IN THE SENATE. PASSAGE WILL SHOW THAT WE WANT STRONG BORDERS &amp, SECURITY WHILE THE DEMS WANT OPEN BORDERS = CRIME.  WIN!
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations to Maxine Waters, whose crazy rants have made her, together with Nancy Pelosi, the unhinged FACE of the Democrat Party. Together, they will Make America Weak Again! But have no fear, America is now stronger than ever before, and I’m not going anywhere!

Big and conclusive win by Mitt Romney. Congratulations! I look forward to working together - there is so much good to do. A great and loving family will be coming to D.C.

The Democrats are in Turmoil! Open Borders and unchecked Crime a certain way to lose elections. Republicans are for Strong Borders, NO Crime! A BIG NIGHT!
<|endoftext|>
Wow! Big Trump Hater Congressman Joe Crowley, who many expected was going to take Nancy Pelosi’s place, just LOST his primary election. In other words, he’s out! That is a big one that nobody saw happening. Perhaps he should have been nicer, and more respectful, to his President!
<|endoftext|>
Tremendous win for Congressman Dan Donovan. You showed great courage in a tough race! New York, and my many friends on Staten Island, have elected someone they have always been very proud of. Congratulations!

The face of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who, together with Nancy Pelosi, have established a fine leadership team. They should always stay together and lead the Democrats, who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime, well into the future....and pick Crooked Hillary for Pres.

A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country-never! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end - they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!

It was great being with Governor Henry McMaster last night in South Carolina. Henry is tough on Crime and Borders, loves our Military and our Vets and has created many jobs and a great economy. GO OUT AND VOTE FOR HENRY TODAY, HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!

....We are finishing our study of Tariffs on cars from the E.U. in that they have long taken advantage of the U.S. in the form of Trade Barriers and Tariffs. In the end it will all even out - and it won’t take very long!
<|endoftext|>
....When I had Harley-Davidson officials over to the White House, I chided them about tariffs in other countries, like India, being too high. Companies are now coming back to America. Harley must know that they won’t be able to sell back into U.S. without paying a big tax!
<|endoftext|>
....We are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers, workers and companies. We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. They must play fair or they will pay tariffs!
<|endoftext|>
Early this year Harley-Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand. That was long before Tariffs were announced. Hence, they were just using Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse. Shows how unbalanced &amp, unfair trade is, but we will fix it.....
<|endoftext|>

The hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI &amp, DOJ should be shown to the public on live television, not a closed door hearing that nobody will see. We should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency!
<|endoftext|>
Why is Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), perhaps in a near drunken state, claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller, the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt, knows? Isn’t this highly illegal. Is it being investigated?
<|endoftext|>
Surprised that Harley-Davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the White Flag. I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U., which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion. Taxes just a Harley excuse - be patient!  #MAGA
<|endoftext|>
Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!

....If this is done, illegal immigration will be stopped in it’s tracks - and at very little, by comparison, cost. This is the only real answer - and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL!
<|endoftext|>
Hiring manythousands of judges, and going through a long and complicated legal process, is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional. People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the U.S. illegally. Children brought back to their country......
<|endoftext|>
Such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the Obama Administration and ours. Actually, we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under Obama. Fake News is working overtime!
<|endoftext|>
I have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI (although I do not legally have to), because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on. But you do have to ask why the DOJ &amp, FBI aren’t giving over requested documents?

The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside!

House Republicans could easily pass a Bill on Strong Border Security but remember, it still has to pass in the Senate, and for that we need 10 Democrat votes, and all they do is RESIST. They want Open Borders and don’t care about Crime! Need more Republicans to WIN in November!

The United States is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial Trade Barriers and Tariffs on goods going into their country, remove those Barriers &amp, Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the U.S.A. Trade must be fair and no longer a one way street!

....Our Immigration policy, laughed at all over the world, is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years! Immigration must be based on merit - we need people who will help to Make America Great Again!

We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country. When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order. Most children come without parents...
<|endoftext|>
Democrats, fix the laws. Don’t RESIST. We are doing a far better job than Bush and Obama, but we need strength and security at the Border! Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country. Strong Borders, No Crime!

It’s very sad that Nancy Pelosi and her sidekick, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, want to protect illegal immigrants far more than the citizens of our country. The United States cannot stand for this. We wants safety and security at our borders!

80% of Mexico’s Exports come to the United States. They totally rely on us, which is fine with me. They do have, though, very strong Immigration Laws. The U.S. has pathetically weak and ineffective Immigration Laws that the Democrats refuse to help us fix. Will speak to Mexico!

Even if we get 100% Republican votes in the Senate, we need 10 Democrat votes to get a much needed Immigration Bill - &amp, the Dems are Obstructionists who won’t give votes for political reasons &amp, because they don’t care about Crime coming from Border! So we need to elect more R’s!

I’ve had to beat 17 very talented people including the Bush Dynasty, then I had to beat the Clinton Dynasty, and now I have to beat a phony Witch Hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the IG Report...and never forget the Fake News Media. It never ends!

Wow, what a tough sentence for Paul Manafort, who has represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other top political people and campaigns. Didn’t know Manafort was the head of the Mob. What about Comey and Crooked Hillary and all of the others? Very unfair!
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda. Any Immigration Bill MUST HAVE full funding for the Wall, end Catch &amp, Release, Visa Lottery and Chain, and go to Merit Based Immigration. Go for it! WIN!

Thank you for all of the compliments on getting the World Cup to come to the U.S.A., Mexico and Canada. I worked hard on this, along with a Great Team of talented people. We never fail, and it will be a great World Cup! A special thanks to Bob Kraft for excellent advice.

The IG Report is a total disaster for Comey, his minions and sadly, the FBI. Comey will now officially go down as the worst leader, by far, in the history of the FBI. I did a great service to the people in firing him. Good Instincts. Christopher Wray will bring it proudly back!

....Schneiderman, who ran the Clinton campaign in New York, never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case, which lingered in their office for almost 2 years. Now he resigned his office in disgrace, and his disciples brought it when we would not settle.
<|endoftext|>
The sleazy New York Democrats, and their now disgraced (and run out of town) A.G. Eric Schneiderman, are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in $18,800,000 and gave out to charity more money than it took in, $19,200,000. I won’t settle this case!...
<|endoftext|>
So, the Democrats make up a phony crime, Collusion with the Russians, pay a fortune to make the crime sound real, illegally leak (Comey) classified information so that a Special Councel will be appointed, and then Collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in Fake News!
<|endoftext|>
Now that I am back from Singapore, where we had a great result with respect to North Korea, the thought process must sadly go back to the Witch Hunt, always remembering that there was No Collusion and No Obstruction of the fabricated No Crime.

So funny to watch the Fake News, especially NBC and CNN. They are fighting hard to downplay the deal with North Korea. 500 days ago they would have “begged” for this deal-looked like war would break out. Our Country’s biggest enemy is the Fake News so easily promulgated by fools!

My political representatives didn’t want me to get involved in the Mark Sanford primary thinking that Sanford would easily win - but with a few hours left I felt that Katie was such a good candidate, and Sanford was so bad, I had to give it a shot. Congrats to Katie Arrington!
<|endoftext|>
A year ago the pundits &amp, talking heads, people that couldn’t do the job before, were begging for conciliation and peace - “please meet, don’t go to war.” Now that we meet and have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un, the same haters shout out, “you shouldn’t meet, do not meet!”

Mark Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA. He is MIA and nothing but trouble. He is better off in Argentina. I fully endorse Katie Arrington for Congress in SC, a state I love. She is tough on crime and will continue our fight to lower taxes. VOTE Katie!

The fact that I am having a meeting is a major loss for the U.S., say the haters &amp, losers. We have our hostages, testing, research and all missle launches have stoped, and these pundits, who have called me wrong from the beginning, have nothing else they can say! We will be fine!

....Germany pays 1% (slowly) of GDP towards NATO, while we pay 4% of a MUCH larger GDP. Does anybody believe that makes sense? We protect Europe (which is good) at great financial loss, and then get unfairly clobbered on Trade. Change is coming!
<|endoftext|>
....And add to that the fact that the U.S. pays close to the entire cost of NATO-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on Trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh!). The European Union had a $151 Billion Surplus-should pay much more for Military!
<|endoftext|>
Why should I, as President of the United States, allow countries to continue to make Massive Trade Surpluses, as they have for decades, while our Farmers, Workers &amp, Taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay? Not fair to the PEOPLE of America! $800 Billion Trade Deficit...
<|endoftext|>
Fair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal. According to a Canada release, they make almost 100 Billion Dollars in Trade with U.S. (guess they were bragging and got caught!). Minimum is 17B. Tax Dairy from us at 270%. Then Justin acts hurt when called out!
<|endoftext|>
Based on Justin’s false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers, workers and companies, I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!

The United States will not allow other countries to impose massive Tariffs and Trade Barriers on its farmers, workers and companies. While sending their product into our country tax free. We have put up with Trade Abuse for many decades — and that is long enough.

Obama, Schumer and Pelosi did NOTHING about North Korea, and now weak on Crime, High Tax Schumer is telling me what to do at the Summit the Dems could never set up. Schumer failed with North Korea and Iran, we don’t need his advice!

Why isn’t the European Union and Canada informing the public that for years they have used massive Trade Tariffs and non-monetary Trade Barriers against the U.S. Totally unfair to our farmers, workers &amp, companies. Take down your tariffs &amp, barriers or we will more than match you!
<|endoftext|>
Prime Minister Trudeau is being so indignant, bringing up the relationship that the U.S. and Canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things...but he doesn’t bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300% on dairy — hurting our Farmers, killing our Agriculture!
<|endoftext|>
Please tell Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron that they are charging the U.S. massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers. The EU trade surplus with the U.S. is $151 Billion, and Canada keeps our farmers and others out. Look forward to seeing them tomorrow.
<|endoftext|>
The Obama Administration is now accused of trying to give Iran secret access to the financial system of the United States. This is totally illegal. Perhaps we could get the 13 Angry Democrats to divert some of their energy to this “matter” (as Comey would call it). Investigate!

When will people start saying, “thank you, Mr. President, for firing James Comey?”

Our Justice Department must not let Awan &amp, Debbie Wasserman Schultz off the hook. The Democrat I.T. scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today. They want to make a “plea deal” to hide what is on their Server. Where is Server? Really bad!

How could Jeff Flake, who is setting record low polling numbers in Arizona and was therefore humiliatingly forced out of his own Senate seat without even a fight (and who doesn’t have a clue), think about running for office, even a lower one, again? Let’s face it, he’s a Flake!

The Fake News Media has been so unfair, and vicious, to my wife and our great First Lady, Melania. During her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death, to facelift, to left the W.H. (and me) for N.Y. or Virginia, to abuse. All Fake, she is doing really well!
<|endoftext|>

The United States must, at long last, be treated fairly on Trade. If we charge a country ZERO to sell their goods, and they charge us 25, 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours, it is UNFAIR and can no longer be tolerated. That is not Free or Fair Trade, it is Stupid Trade!

California has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime, high tax, problems - along with so many others. On June 5th., vote for GOP Gubernatorial Candidate JOHN COX, a really good and highly competent man. He’ll Make California Great Again!

A Democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to Repeal the GOP Tax Cuts (no chance). This is too good to be true for Republicans...Remember, the Nancy Pelosi Dems are also weak on Crime, the Border and want to be gentle and kind to MS-13 gang members...not good!

Why didn’t President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election? Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win, and he didn’t want to upset the apple cart! He was in charge, not me, and did nothing.

Who’s going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony Russia Collusion Witch Hunt? They journeyed down to Washington, D.C., with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation...They went back home in tatters!
<|endoftext|>
When will the 13 Angry Democrats (&amp, those who worked for President O), reveal their disqualifying Conflicts of Interest? It’s been a long time now! Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems, Justice, FBI &amp, Russia?
<|endoftext|>
This whole Russia Probe is Rigged. Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that haven’t been lost in decades. 13 Angry Democrats, and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for 8 years. #SPYGATE &amp, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST!
<|endoftext|>
With Spies, or “Informants” as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it’s not), all over my campaign, even from a very early date, why didn’t the crooked highest levels of the FBI or “Justice” contact me to tell me of the  phony Russia problem?

“Everyone knows there was a Spy, and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a Spy...Widespread Spying involving multiple people.” Mollie Hemingway, The Federalist Senior Editor  But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story!

Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? And to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, LOST!
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party’s campaign is different than having a Spy, as illegal as that may be. But what about an “Informant” who is paid a fortune and who “sets up” way earlier than the Russian Hoax?

<|endoftext|>
...Follow the money! The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia, because there was no Collusion. He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win - just like they did to Bernie Sanders, who got duped!
<|endoftext|>
If the person placed very early into my campaign wasn’t a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes, how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal...

<|endoftext|>
I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!

The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia - so now they’re looking at the rest of the World. Oh’ great!
<|endoftext|>
....and why hasn’t the Podesta brother been charged and arrested, like others, after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington, D.C.?

What ever happened to the Server, at the center of so much Corruption, that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI? They broke into homes &amp, offices early in the morning, but were afraid to take the Server?

Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World, they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party. Don’t worry about Dems FISA Abuse, missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier!
<|endoftext|>
...in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted 33,000 Emails, got $145,000,000 while Secretary of State, paid McCabes wife $700,000 (and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M) and so much more. Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam.
<|endoftext|>
....At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia, No Obstruction, but they aren’t looking at the corruption...

If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign, that is a really big deal. Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also, Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. Drain the Swamp!

The White House is running very smoothly despite phony Witch Hunts etc. There is great Energy and unending Stamina, both necessary to get things done. We are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so! Fake News is going “bonkers!”

The Fake News is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don’t exist). They are totally unhinged, and the great success of this Administration is making them do and say things that even they can’t believe they are saying. Truly bad people!

Comey throws AG Lynch “under the bus!” Why can’t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat, or AG, in order to lay off Hillary. No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!

The big questions in Comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn’t they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabe’s $700,000 &amp, more?

Unbelievably, James Comey states that Polls, where Crooked Hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe. In other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job. Slimeball!

39% of my nominations, including Diplomats to foreign lands, have not been confirmed due to Democrat obstruction and delay. At this rate, it would take more than 7 years before I am allowed to have these great people start working. Never happened before. Disgraceful!

Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the U.S. is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL. Democrats allow open borders, drugs and crime!
<|endoftext|>
As ridiculous as it sounds, the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from. A whole big wasted procedure must take place. Mexico &amp, Canada have tough immigration laws, whereas ours are an Obama joke. ACT CONGRESS

So sad that the Department of “Justice” and the FBI are slow walking, or even not giving, the unredacted documents requested by Congress. An embarrassment to our country!

Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!

So funny to watch Fake News Networks, among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with, criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke.

Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA...They have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic. With all of the money they make from the U.S., hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!

DACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!

...Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the weak Dem laws don’t allow them to do their job. Act now Congress, our country is being stolen!

Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large “Caravans” of people enter their country. They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws.....

These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA. They want in on the act!

Mexico is doing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border, and then into the U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA. NEED WALL!
<|endoftext|>
Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch &amp, Release. Getting more dangerous. “Caravans” coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!

<|endoftext|>
While we are on the subject, it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars. The Failing N.Y. Times reports that “the size of the company’s lobbying staff has ballooned,” and that...

Much can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall. It is just a down payment. Work will start immediately. The rest of the money will come - and remember DACA, the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)!

Because of the $700 &amp, $716 Billion Dollars gotten to rebuild our Military, many jobs are created and our Military is again rich. Building a great Border Wall, with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country, is all about National Defense. Build WALL through M!

News conference at the White House concerning the Omnibus Spending Bill.  1:00 P.M.
<|endoftext|>
I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.
<|endoftext|>
DACA was abandoned by the Democrats. Very unfair to them! Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall.

House Intelligence Committee votes to release final report. FINDINGS: (1) No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign &amp, Russia. (2)  The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient. (3) Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts.

Remember when they were saying, during the campaign, that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds, but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary’s large and highly sophisticated staff. Well, not saying that anymore!

Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault. He doesn’t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don’t threaten people Joe!

Democrats refused to take care of DACA. Would have been so easy, but they just didn’t care. I had to fight for Military and start of Wall.

Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming. Most importantly, got $700 Billion to rebuild our Military, $716 Billion next year...most ever. Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.

Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?
<|endoftext|>
The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!
<|endoftext|>
The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife’s campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!

As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice &amp, State. #DrainTheSwamp

<|endoftext|>
....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!

Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? Why didn’t Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren’t Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions!

A woman I don’t know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago. Never happened! Who would do this in a public space with live security......

I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts. Total Fake News!

Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new “pushed” Congressional Map, all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary. Your Original was correct! Don’t let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes &amp, waste money!

Stock Market up big. New and Historic Record. Job, jobs, jobs!

Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll, perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away. Actually, they want to raise you taxes, substantially. Also, they want to do nothing on DACA, R’s want to fix!

....The President Obama quote just before election. That’s because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to “rock the boat.” When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems.

“There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America’s elections, there’s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time, and so I’d invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.” .....

The U.S. economy is looking very good, in my opinion, even better than anticipated. Companies are pouring back into our country, reversing the long term trend of leaving. The unemployment numbers are looking great, and Regulations &amp, Taxes have been massively Cut! JOBS, JOBS, JOBS

Obama was President up to, and beyond, the 2016 Election. So why didn’t he do something about Russian meddling?

Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election. But wasn’t I a great candidate?
<|endoftext|>
I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said “it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.” The Russian “hoax” was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!
<|endoftext|>
Finally, Liddle’ Adam Schiff, the leakin’ monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President, knew of the threat, and did nothing. Thank you Adam!

Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress, the FBI or Justice called for an investigation!

General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!

Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!

Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem, why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House &amp, Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk!

Funny how the Fake News Media doesn’t want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn’t know!

...lottery, continues deadly catch-and-release, and bars enforcement even for FUTURE illegal immigrants. Voting for this amendment would be a vote AGAINST law enforcement, and a vote FOR open borders. If Dems are actually serious about DACA, they should support the Grassley bill!

While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA, they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA!

So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!

My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.

Negotiations on DACA have begun. Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal. Wouldn’t it be great if we could finally, after so many years, solve the DACA puzzle. This will be our last chance, there will never be another opportunity! March 5th.

Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except, of course, the Democrats. After many years we have taken care of our Military, now we have to fix our roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and more. Bipartisan, make deal Dems?

Rep. Lou Barletta, a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters, will make a FANTASTIC Senator. He is strong &amp, smart, loves Pennsylvania &amp, loves our Country! Voted for Tax Cuts, unlike Bob Casey, who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer!

Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do. The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011, and they decided not to do anything about DACA. They only want to use it as a campaign issue. Vote Republican!

Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election, and beyond. This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military, but much waste in order to get Dem votes. Fortunately, DACA not included in this Bill, negotiations to start now!
<|endoftext|>
Without more Republicans in Congress, we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally, after many years of depletion, take care of our Military. Sadly, we needed some Dem votes for passage. Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election!

Just signed Bill. Our Military will now be stronger than ever before. We love and need our Military and gave them everything — and more. First time this has happened in a long time. Also means JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!

I have offered DACA a wonderful deal, including a doubling in the number of recipients &amp, a twelve year pathway to citizenship, for two reasons: (1) Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem. (2) To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA, only use it!

Do you remember two years ago when Iraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria. Many people wanted us to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, who we just fought for. I said no, and the Kurds left the fight, twice. Now the same thing is happening with Turkey......
<|endoftext|>
Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War?

The same people that got us into the Middle East Quicksand, 8 Trillion Dollars and many thousands of lives (and millions of lives when you count the other side), are now fighting to keep us there. Don’t listen to people that haven’t got a clue. They have proven to be inept!

Rep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE &amp, terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people. It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason?
<|endoftext|>
The Fake Whistleblower complaint is not holding up. It is mostly about the call to the Ukrainian President which, in the name of transparency, I immediately released to Congress &amp,  the public. The Whistleblower knew almost nothing, its 2ND HAND description of the call is a fraud!

These Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, are doing great harm to our Country. They are lying &amp, cheating like never before in our Country’s history in order to destabilize the United States of America &amp, it’s upcoming 2020 Election. They &amp, the Fake News Media are Dangerous &amp, Bad!
<|endoftext|>
....In addition, I want to meet not only my accuser, who presented SECOND &amp, THIRD HAND INFORMATION, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the “Whistleblower.” Was this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!
<|endoftext|>
His lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber. He wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud &amp, Treason.....
<|endoftext|>
Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called “Whistleblower,” represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way. Then Schiff made up what I actually said by lying to Congress......
<|endoftext|>
The only people that don’t like my conversation with the new Ukrainian President are those that heard Rep. Adam Schiff read a made up and totally fraudulent statement to the House and public, words that I did not say but that he fabricated (&amp, admitted to this fabrication). Sick!

It is disgraceful what the Do Nothing Democrats are doing (the Impeachment Scam), but it is also disgraceful what they are NOT doing, namely, the USMCA vote, Prescription Drug Price Reduction, Gun Safety, Infrastructure, and much more!

....fraudulently and illegally inserted his made up &amp, twisted words into my call with the Ukrainian President to make it look like I did something very wrong. He then boldly read those words to Congress and millions of people, defaming &amp, libeling me. He must resign from Congress!
<|endoftext|>
The Whistleblower’s complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new President of Ukraine. The so-called “Whistleblower” knew practically NOTHING in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic &amp, wrong, just like Liddle’ Adam Schiff..
<|endoftext|>
....The conversation with the new and very good Ukraine President, who told the Fake News, at the United Nations, that HE WAS NOT PRESSURED BY ME IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, should by and of itself bring an end to the new and most recent Witch Hunt. Others ended in ashes!

If that perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine Isn’t considered appropriate, then no future President can EVER again speak to another foreign leader!

Sounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn’t a Whistleblower at all. In addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?

The Democrats are now to be known as the DO NOTHING PARTY!

<|endoftext|>
Liddle’ Adam Schiff, who has worked unsuccessfully for 3 years to hurt the Republican Party and President, has just said that the Whistleblower, even though he or she only had second hand information, “is credible.” How can that be with zero info and a known bias. Democrat Scam!

So why didn’t the highly conflicted Robert Mueller investigate how and why Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted and acid washed 33,000 Emails immediately AFTER getting a SUBPOENA from the United States Congress? She must have GREAT lawyers!
<|endoftext|>
Why didn’t Robert Mueller &amp, his band of 18 Angry Democrats spend any time investigating Crooked Hillary Clinton, Lyin’ &amp, Leakin’ James Comey, Lisa Page and her Psycho lover, Peter S, Andy McCabe, the beautiful Ohr family, Fusion GPS, and many more,  including HIMSELF &amp, Andrew W?
<|endoftext|>
It was NEVER agreed that Robert Mueller could use one of his many Democrat Never Trumper lawyers to sit next to him and help him with his answers. This was specifically NOT agreed to, and I would NEVER have agreed to it. The Greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. history, by far!
<|endoftext|>
So Democrats and others can illegally fabricate a crime, try pinning it on a very innocent President, and when he fights back against this illegal and treasonous attack on our Country, they call It Obstruction? Wrong! Why didn’t Robert Mueller investigate the investigators?
<|endoftext|>
So Robert Mueller has now asked for his long time Never Trumper lawyer to sit beside him and help with answers. What’s this all about? His lawyer represented the “basement server guy” who got off free in the Crooked Hillary case. This should NOT be allowed. Rigged Witch Hunt!
<|endoftext|>
Just got back only to hear of a last minute change allowing a Never Trumper attorney to help Robert Mueller with his testimony before Congress tomorrow. What a disgrace to our system. Never heard of this before. VERY UNFAIR, SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. A rigged Witch Hunt!

Fake News Equals the Enemy of the People!
<|endoftext|>
The Mainstream Media is out of control. They constantly lie and cheat in order to get their Radical Left Democrat views out their for all to see. It has never been this bad. They have gone bonkers, &amp, no longer care what is right or wrong. This large scale false reporting is sick!
<|endoftext|>
....except for those stated by me, &amp, “reams of paper” were never given to me. It is a made up story meant to demean &amp, belittle. The Post had no sources. The facts remain the same, that we have 4 Radical Left Congresswomen who have said very bad things about Israel &amp, our Country!
<|endoftext|>
The Amazon Washington Post front page story yesterday was total Fake News. They said “Advisors wrote new talking points and handed him reams of opposition research on the four Congresswomen.” Now really, does that sound like me? What advisors, there were no talking points,....
<|endoftext|>
It is far more costly for the Federal Reserve to cut deeper if the economy actually does, in the future, turn down! Very inexpensive, in fact productive,  to move now. The Fed raised &amp, tightened far too much &amp, too fast. In other words, they missed it (Big!). Don’t miss it again!
<|endoftext|>
....as we have done, it could have been soooo much better. Interest rate costs should have been much lower, &amp, GDP &amp, our Country’s wealth accumulation much higher. Such a waste of time &amp, money. Also, very unfair that other countries manipulate their currencies and pump money in!
<|endoftext|>
With almost no inflation, our Country is needlessly being forced to pay a MUCH higher interest rate than other countries only because of a very misguided Federal Reserve. In addition, Quantitative Tightening is continuing, making it harder for our Country to compete. As good.....

....Based on the comments made by Senator Schumer, he must have seen how dangerous &amp, bad for our Country the Border is. It is not a “manufactured crisis,” as the Fake News Media &amp, their Democrat partners tried to portray. He said he wants to meet. I will set up a meeting ASAP!

Senator Chuck Schumer has finally gone to the Southern Border with some Democrat Senators. This is a GREAT thing! Nearby, he missed a large group of Illegal Immigrants trying to enter the USA illegally. They wildly  rushed Border Patrol. Some Agents were badly injured....

<|endoftext|>
I don’t believe the four Congresswomen are capable of loving our Country. They should apologize to America (and Israel) for the horrible (hateful) things they have said. They are destroying the Democrat Party, but are weak &amp, insecure people who can never destroy our great Nation!

Because of the faulty thought process we have going for us at the Federal Reserve, we pay much higher interest rates than countries that are no match for us economically. In other words, our interest costs are much higher than other countries, when they should be lower. Correct!

If the totally Corrupt Media was less corrupt, I would be up by 15 points in the polls based on our tremendous success with the economy, maybe Best Ever! If the Corrup Media was actually fair, I would be up by 25 points. Nevertheless, despite the Fake News, we’re doing great!

In order not to pay Tariffs, if they start rising, companies will leave Mexico, which has taken 30% of our Auto Industry, and come back home to the USA. Mexico must take back their country from the drug lords and cartels. The Tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals!

OK, so after two years of hard work and each party trying their best to make the other party look as bad as possible, it’s time to get back to business. The Mueller Report strongly stated that there was No Collusion with Russia (of course) and, in fact, they were rebuffed.....

Looks like Bob Mueller’s team of 13 Trump Haters &amp, Angry Democrats are illegally leaking information to the press while the Fake News Media make up their own stories with or without sources - sources no longer matter to our corrupt &amp, dishonest Mainstream Media, they are a Joke!
<|endoftext|>
....In the meantime, the Democrats in Congress must help the Republicans (we need their votes) to end the horrible, costly and foolish loopholes in our Immigration Laws. Once that happens, all will be smooth. We can NEVER allow Open Borders!
<|endoftext|>
....it’s powerful common sense Immigration Laws to stop illegals from coming through Mexico into the U.S., and removing them back to their country of origin. Until Mexico cleans up this ridiculous &amp, massive migration, we will be focusing on Border Security, not Ports of Entry....
<|endoftext|>
We have redeployed 750 agents at the Southern Border’s specific Ports of Entry in order to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants trying to make their way into the United States. This will cause traffic &amp, commercial delays until such time as Mexico is able to use....

Why should I be defending a fraudulent Russian Witch Hunt. It’s about time the perpetrators of this fraud on me and the American People start defending their dishonest and treasonous acts. How and why did this terrible event begin? Never Forget!

<|endoftext|>
So, let’s get this straight! There was No Collusion and in fact the Phony Dossier was a Con Job that was paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. So the 13 Angry Democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up Fraud. I just fought back....

Just checked out the new Wall on the Border - GREAT! Leaving now for L.A.

Will soon be landing in Calexico, California to look at a portion of the new WALL being built on our Southern Border. Within two years we will have close to 400 miles built or under construction &amp, keeping our Country SAFE – not easy when the Dems are always fighting to stop you!
<|endoftext|>
The press is doing everything within their power to fight the magnificence of the phrase, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! They can’t stand the fact that this Administration has done more than virtually any other Administration in its first 2yrs. They are truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!

<|endoftext|>
....However, if for any reason Mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from, the U.S. will be forced to Tariff at 25% all cars made in Mexico and shipped over the Border to us. If that doesn’t work, which it will, I will close the Border.......
<|endoftext|>
The Crazed and Dishonest Washington Post again purposely got it wrong. Mexico, for the first time in decades, is meaningfully apprehending illegals at THEIR Southern Border, before the long march up to the U.S. This is great and the way it should be. The big flow will stop.......
<|endoftext|>
The New York Times had no legitimate sources, which would be totally illegal, concerning the Mueller Report. In fact, they probably had no sources at all! They are a Fake News paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me!

There is nothing we can ever give to the Democrats that will make them happy. This is the highest level of Presidential Harassment in the history of our Country!

According to polling, few people seem to care about the Russian Collusion Hoax, but some Democrats are fighting hard to keep the Witch Hunt alive. They should focus on legislation or, even better, an investigation of how the ridiculous Collusion Delusion got started - so illegal!

After many years (decades), Mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their Southern Border, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. They have ALL been taking U.S. money for years, and doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for us, just like the Democrats in Congress!

There is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy Jerry Nadler or Shifty Adam Schiff. It is now time to focus exclusively on properly running our great Country!
<|endoftext|>
Robert Mueller was a God-like figure to the Democrats, until he ruled No Collusion in the long awaited $30,000,000 Mueller Report. Now the Dems don’t even acknowledge his name, have become totally unhinged, and would like to go through the whole process again. It won’t happen!

....The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump. So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted. Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation!

Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, &amp, all their local politicians do is complain &amp, ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, &amp, only take from USA....
<|endoftext|>
....the crazed and incompetent Mayor of San Juan have done such a poor job  of bringing the Island back to health. 91 Billion Dollars to Puerto Rico, and now the Dems want to give them more, taking dollars away from our Farmers and so many others. Disgraceful!
<|endoftext|>
....are GREAT, but the politicians are incompetent or corrupt. Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas &amp, Florida combined, yet their government can’t do anything right, the place is a mess - nothing works. FEMA &amp, the Military worked emergency miracles, but politicians like.....

The Democrats today killed a Bill that would have provided great relief to Farmers and yet more money to Puerto Rico despite the fact that Puerto Rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any “place” in history. The people of Puerto Rico.....
<|endoftext|>
....back the House. It will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America. Also, Republicans will always support Pre-Existing Conditions. The Republican Party will be known as the Party of Great HealtCare. Meantime, the USA is doing better than ever &amp, is respected again!
<|endoftext|>
Thank you to the House Republicans for sticking together and the BIG WIN today on the Border. Today’s vote simply reaffirms Congressional Democrats are the party of Open Borders, Drugs and Crime!
<|endoftext|>
....are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) &amp, deductibles than ObamaCare. In other words it will be far less expensive &amp, much more usable than ObamaCare. Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate &amp, win......
<|endoftext|>
Everybody agrees that ObamaCare doesn’t work. Premiums &amp, deductibles are far too high - Really bad HealthCare! Even the Dems want to replace it, but with Medicare for all, which would cause 180 million Americans to lose their beloved private health insurance. The Republicans.....
<|endoftext|>
Democrats should stop fighting Sen. David Perdue’s disaster relief bill. They are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural America!

No matter what information is given to the crazed Democrats from the No Collusion Mueller Report, it will never be good enough. Behind closed doors the Dems are laughing!
<|endoftext|>
Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question. Report would be meaningless and a waste of the $Billions (ridiculous) that it costs to put together!
<|endoftext|>
Democrats, working with Republicans in Congress, can fix the Asylum and other loopholes quickly. We have a major National Emergency at our Border. GET IT DONE NOW!
<|endoftext|>
Now that the long awaited Mueller Report conclusions have been released, most Democrats and othershave gone back to the pre-Witch Hunt phase of their lives before Collusion Delusion took over. Others are pretending that their former hero, Bob Mueller, no longer exists!
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats are allowing a ridiculous asylum system and major loopholes to remain as a mainstay of our immigration system. Mexico is likewise doing NOTHING, a very bad combination for our Country. Homeland Security is being sooo very nice, but not for long!
<|endoftext|>
Everybody is asking how the phony and fraudulent investigation of the No Collusion, No Obstruction Trump Campaign began. We need to know for future generations to understand. This Hoax should never be allowed to happen to another President or Administration again!
<|endoftext|>
Mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the USA. Our detention areas are maxed out &amp, we will take no more illegals. Next step is to close the Border! This will also help us with stopping the Drug flow from Mexico!
<|endoftext|>
It would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid Democrat inspired immigration laws. In less than one hour, and then a vote, the problem would be solved. But the Dems don’t care about the crime, they don’t want any victory for Trump and the Republicans, even if good for USA!
<|endoftext|>
So funny that The New York Times &amp, The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia - And there was No Collusion! So, they were either duped or corrupt? In any event, their prizes should be taken away by the Committee!
<|endoftext|>
...The problem is, no matter what the Radical Left Democrats get, no matter what we give them, it will never be enough. Just watch, they will Harass &amp, Complain &amp, Resist (the theme of their movement). So maybe we should just take our victory and say NO, we’ve got a Country to run!
<|endoftext|>
Robert Mueller was a Hero to the Radical Left Democrats, until he ruled that there was No Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous to even say!). After more than two years since the “insurance policy” statement was made by a dirty cop, I got the answers I wanted, the Truth.....

Had the Fed not mistakenly raised interest rates, especially since there is very little inflation, and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening, the 3.0% GDP, &amp, Stock Market, would have both been much higher &amp, World Markets would be in a better place!

....the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and “talk.” Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing!
<|endoftext|>
....through their country and our Southern Border. Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING.....
<|endoftext|>
The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, &amp, they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S. Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, &amp, Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S....

Campaigning for the Popular Vote is much easier &amp, different than campaigning for the Electoral College. It’s like training for the 100 yard dash vs. a marathon. The brilliance of the Electoral College is that you must go to many States to win. With the Popular Vote, you go to....

Bad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a Pardon. His lawyers totally contradicted him. He lied! Additionally, he directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO. He lied again! He also badly wanted to work at the White House. He lied!

The military drills, or war games as I call them, were never even discussed in my mtg w/ Kim Jong Un of NK—FAKE NEWS! I made that decision long ago because it costs the U.S. far too much money to have those “games”, especially since we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost!

“Look how they’re acting now and how we act when we’re in the majority. What the Democrats are doing is an abuse of power. They couldn’t find anything...they took a Fake Dossier &amp, couldn’t find any Collusion. Now they have a fake witness in Cohen.” Congressman Mark Green, (R-TN).
<|endoftext|>
After more than two years of Presidential Harassment, the only things that have been proven is that Democrats and other broke the law. The hostile Cohen testimony, given by a liar to reduce his prison time, proved no Collusion! His just written book manuscript showed what he.....

...said was a total lie, but Fake Media won’t show it. I am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad, conflicted &amp, corrupt people in a Witch Hunt that is illegal &amp, should never have been allowed to start - And only because I won the Election! Despite this, great success!

I never like being misinterpreted, but especially when it comes to Otto Warmbier and his great family. Remember, I got Otto out along with three others. The previous Administration did nothing, and he was taken on their watch. Of course I hold North Korea responsible....

Michael Cohen’s book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before. He must have forgotten about his book when he testified. What does Hillary Clinton’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, say about this one. Is he being paid by Crooked Hillary. Using her lawyer?
<|endoftext|>
...and the fraudulent and dishonest statements he made on Wednesday. No way, it’s time to stop this corrupt and illegally brought Witch Hunt. Time to start looking at the other side where real crimes were committed. Republicans have been abused long enough. Must end now!
<|endoftext|>
Oh’ I see! Now that the 2 year Russian Collusion case has fallen apart, there was no Collusion except bye Crooked Hillary and the Democrats, they say, “gee, I have an idea, let’s look at Trump’s finances and every deal he has ever done. Let’s follow discredited Michael Cohen.....

Congress must demand the transcript of Michael Cohen’s new book, given to publishers a short time ago. Your heads will spin when you see the lies, misrepresentations and contradictions  against his Thursday testimony. Like a different person! He is totally discredited!
<|endoftext|>
Wow, just revealed that Michael Cohen wrote a “love letter to Trump” manuscript for a new book that he was pushing. Written and submitted long after Charlottesville and Helsinki, his phony reasons for going rogue. Book is exact opposite of his fake testimony, which now is a lie!

Michael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately). He had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying &amp, fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time. Using Crooked’s lawyer!

I have now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal, the third rate Senator from Connecticut (how is Connecticut doing?). His war stories of his heroism in Vietnam were a total fraud - he was never even there. We talked about it today with Vietnamese leaders!

The Democrats should stop talking about what I should do with North Korea and ask themselves instead why they didn’t do “it” during eight years of the Obama Administration?

The Democrats just don’t seem to want Border Security. They are fighting Border Agents recommendations. If you believe news reports, they are not offering much for the Wall. They look to be making this a campaign issue. The Wall will get built one way or the other!

We have a great economy DESPITE the Obama Administration and all of its job killing Regulations and Roadblocks. If that thinking prevailed in the 2016 Election, the U.S. would be in a Depression right now! We were heading down, and don’t let the Democrats sound bites fool you!

North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, will become a great Economic Powerhouse. He may surprise some but he won’t surprise me, because I have gotten to know him &amp, fully understand how capable he is. North Korea will become a different kind of Rocket - an Economic one!

The rank and file of the FBI are great people who are disgusted with what they are learning about Lyin’ James Comey and the so-called “leaders” of the FBI. Twelve have been fired or forced to leave. They got caught spying on my campaign and then called it an investigation. Bad!

The Trump portrait of an unsustainable Border Crisis is dead on. “In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with Criminal Records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes &amp, 4000 violent killings.” America’s Southern....

I just watched a Fake reporter from the Amazon Washington Post say the White House is “chaotic, there does not seem to be a strategy for this Shutdown. There is no plan.” The Fakes always like talking Chaos, there is NONE. In fact, there’s almost nobody in the W.H. but me, and...

Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason &amp, with no proof, after I fired Lyin’ James Comey, a total sleaze!

I often said during rallies, with little variation, that “Mexico will pay for the Wall.” We have just signed a great new Trade Deal with Mexico. It is Billions of Dollars a year better than the very bad NAFTA deal which it replaces. The difference pays for Wall many times over!

We lose 300 Americans a week, 90% of which comes through the Southern Border. These numbers will be DRASTICALLY REDUCED if we have a Wall!

There is GREAT unity with the Republicans in the House and Senate, despite the Fake News Media working in overdrive to make the story look otherwise. The Opposition Party &amp, the Dems know we must have Strong Border Security, but don’t want to give “Trump” another one of many wins!
<|endoftext|>
Cryin Chuck told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that I “slammed the table &amp, walked out of the room. He had a temper tantrum.” Because I knew he would say that, and after Nancy said no to proper Border Security, I politely said bye-bye and left, no slamming!

Gave an OFF THE RECORD luncheon, somewhat of a White House tradition or custom, to network anchors yesterday - and they quickly leaked the contents of the meeting. Who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media, which has gone totally bonkers!

The Mainstream Media has NEVER been more dishonest than it is now. NBC and MSNBC are going Crazy. They report stories, purposely, the exact opposite of the facts. They are truly the Opposition Party working with the Dems. May even be worse than Fake News CNN, if that is possible!
<|endoftext|>
Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!

The Democrats want Billions of Dollars for Foreign Aid, but they don’t want to spend a small fraction of that number on properly securing our Border. Figure that one out!

We are working hard at the Border, but we need a WALL!  In 2018, 1.7 million pounds of narcotics seized, 17,000 adults arrested with criminal records, and 6000 gang members, including MS-13, apprehended. A big Human Trafficking problem.

I don’t care that most of the workers not getting paid are Democrats, I want to stop the Shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on Strong Border Security! I am in the White House ready to go, where are the Dems?

Many people currently a part of my opposition, including President Obama &amp, the Dems, have had campaign violations, in some cases for very large sums of money. These are civil cases. They paid a fine &amp, settled. While no big deal, I did not commit a campaign violation!
<|endoftext|>
The Democrats could solve the Shutdown problem in a very short period of time. All they have to do is approve REAL Border Security (including a Wall), something which everyone, other than drug dealers, human traffickers and criminals, want very badly! This would be so easy to do!

How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time, done nothing wrong (no Collusion with Russia, it was the Dems that Colluded), had the most successful first two years of any president, and is the most popular Republican in party history 93%?
<|endoftext|>
As I have stated many times, if the Democrats take over the House or Senate, there will be disruption to the Financial Markets. We won the Senate, they won the House. Things will settle down. They only want to impeach me because they know they can’t win in 2020, too much success!

The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election. The Democrats know they can’t win based on all of the achievements of “Trump,” so they are going all out on the desperately needed Wall and Border Security - and Presidential Harassment. For them, strictly politics!

Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake?  I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn’t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player &amp, WIN!
